"November 9, 2017","I love this app"
"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"

"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"

It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."

"April 30, 2013","i loved this app at first especially after switching from pandora to this it seemed to have all the same functions plus you could stream internet stations as well but after a while i noticed some songs are censored. there is a setting for explicit content but it just keeps you from using custom stations other than that its a pretty great replacement for pandora and its FREE WITH NO LIMITS!!! ALSO YOU DONT NEED FACEBOOK.i dont have it and i have saved custom stations"
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"
"November 9, 2017","Love this app"
"November 9, 2017","I love this app"
"November 10, 2017","Love it!"
"November 11, 2017","I LOVE this app💖💖.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!"
"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"May 9, 2017","Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work"
"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"

"September 21, 2013","Love the commercial free app. Sometimes there is a 30 second ad at the beginning then that's it for hours. I don't like that you can only skip so many times a day because sometimes there is some really horrid stuff."
"July 27, 2017","I go walking at the ""Y"" about 4 times a week, and the music makes it so much more enjoyable!"

"November 7, 2016","Love this app! So much better than Pandora! I love that I can listen to my favorite radio host since she know longer is broadcast in Utah. Thank you and love Delilah!"
"February 9, 2013","It does not state that a facebook account is NEEDED to use this. Oh, you seen the Facebook icon when you start up? Hit the maybe later button! Before you freak out and throw a hundred 1-* reviews at it, for some of you, stop putting reviews on what you read on the review page. It only states that do you want to use facebook, to like songs and stations, and create so called stations of your own. Facebook isnt needed here, and it shouldnt be needed anywhere, as well as wanted anywhere."

"January 5, 2013","I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

"September 22, 2013","They have an almost inexhaustable library. In addition I found their selection software. more than impressive. All in all a most enjoyable listening experience."
"September 21, 2013","This app is wonderful for reminiscing old favorites and finding new songs and artists. Just when you think they have covered it all they come out with some really great updates that make this app even better! -Thanks !"
"March 4, 2014","I was recently in the hospital for a surgery I had. I had tv in my room, but there was never anything good on tv. So my daughter downloaded I heart radio to my iPhone and my kindle. I couldn't 't fall asleep one night during my hospital stay so I turned on I heart radio. It was amazing!!!! I listened to all my favorite radio stations and songs and it helped me fall asleep. I would recommend it to every one."
"July 3, 2016","I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)"
"April 11, 2014","This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
"September 21, 2013","Love the commercial free app. Sometimes there is a 30 second ad at the beginning then that's it for hours. I don't like that you can only skip so many times a day because sometimes there is some really horrid stuff."
"July 27, 2017","I go walking at the ""Y"" about 4 times a week, and the music makes it so much more enjoyable!"

"February 9, 2013","It does not state that a facebook account is NEEDED to use this. Oh, you seen the Facebook icon when you start up? Hit the maybe later button! Before you freak out and throw a hundred 1-* reviews at it, for some of you, stop putting reviews on what you read on the review page. It only states that do you want to use facebook, to like songs and stations, and create so called stations of your own. Facebook isnt needed here, and it shouldnt be needed anywhere, as well as wanted anywhere."
"June 5, 2015","Pick stations, artists or songs and hit play it's that easy. Plus it remembers what u like and plays similar stuff!!"
"October 27, 2015","Excellent app! Works well, and streams well even in the background with other apps running. Love the customization that it offers. The app learns what music u actually like through your ratings. So rate what you like, and the stations will cater well to you."
"April 30, 2013","i loved this app at first especially after switching from pandora to this it seemed to have all the same functions plus you could stream internet stations as well but after a while i noticed some songs are censored. there is a setting for explicit content but it just keeps you from using custom stations other than that its a pretty great replacement for pandora and its FREE WITH NO LIMITS!!!

Before you freak out and throw a hundred 1-* reviews at it, for some of you, stop putting reviews on what you read on the review page. It only states that do you want to use facebook, to like songs and stations, and create so called stations of your own. Facebook isnt needed here, and it shouldnt be needed anywhere, as well as wanted anywhere."
"June 5, 2015","Pick stations, artists or songs and hit play it's that easy. Plus it remembers what u like and plays similar stuff!!"
"October 27, 2015","Excellent app! Works well, and streams well even in the background with other apps running. Love the customization that it offers. The app learns what music u actually like through your ratings. So rate what you like, and the stations will cater well to you."
"April 30, 2013","i loved this app at first especially after switching from pandora to this it seemed to have all the same functions plus you could stream internet stations as well but after a while i noticed some songs are censored. there is a setting for explicit content but it just keeps you from using custom stations other than that its a pretty great replacement for pandora and its FREE WITH NO LIMITS!!! ALSO YOU DONT NEED FACEBOOK.i dont have it and i have saved custom stations"
