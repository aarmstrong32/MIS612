"2","Amazon","in order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it s just not worth payhing a year in advance for it","William Davidson","June 30, 2016",3,"lots of product but i just didn t use it enough to justify spending over a 100 dollars a year on this plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can t pay monthly which sucks maybe if they started charging monthly i d sign up again the free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought but i never watched a movie or listened to a song on amazon "

"4","Amazon","glad to be able to get the music as a prime member","L..Gerry","April 27, 2016",4,"love that you can download music as a amazon prime member just was a little confusing for me when it asked certain questions on where to store songs and also if there was a charge for the songs that is the only reason i did 4 stars i am not quite as tech savy as some of the younger people so just would have liked a little more explanation love having the music though "

"7","Amazon","amazon does it again","Rebecca Combs","June 17, 2015",5,"this has been a great benefit of being a prime member its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything i love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs it brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues great product or service from amazon again "

"11","Amazon","not bad considering its free","Saul Castillo","June 20, 2014",4,"decent service love the fact that it s bundled w/ prime makes primes an even greater bargain the service itself is useable the music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so so love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services hopefully artists and content will increase with time impossible to give a bad review to free service to prime subscribers but i wouldn t mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed "

"2976","Amazon","very basic no user controls poor documentation","A. Tubesing","March 25, 2011",3," it should be noted that i wrote this review before amazon converted this app to the cloud player so even though this app has the same name as the current one there may be significant changes in how it works now you can search listen to samples and buy songs with this app however there are no user controllable settings and it gives very little information about the song or the album while shopping you also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one click purchases to make it work this is a very basic app which is a good thing to some degree that s what keeps it simple i m glad it s not trying to be everything under one roof i don t want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like itunes does however it is so limited that it s hard to feel like it s easy to use because the limitations require other work arounds ~~~shopping experience:~~~when shopping for songs or albums there s no description reviews or anything else other than the artist title and a date being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature it s quite easy to search for a song quickly find it and listen to a sample before buying it s great if you re not sure what song you re looking for there are some strange things about it though for example several songs and albums i searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices songs from the same name artist and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for 99 and 89 with no explanation of the difference are they different bit rates or something? different formats? with no explanation available and no extra detail about the song who knows what you re getting there seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase you must activate one click on your amazon account to use this app i just started using it so i haven t seen the credit card bill yet but the way this works makes it seem as though there s going to be a separate 99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy this seems a little tedious i would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction it would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so i could just purchase songs as i discover them and have the cost deducted from my balance without paying for each separately i don t want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however so i m not sure if a traditional amazon gift card would work it s all pretty poorly explained if i were going to use this app a lot i would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so i wouldn t have to commingle settings with my web shopping also there seems to be no way to retrieve previously purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted it would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too currently i copy them from my phone to the computer so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? that s not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so called convenience of the apps simplicity ~~~app experience:~~~because there are no user controls you can t specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own and therefore are unable to show and play the new music so i had to install a file manager app and each time i buy a song i have to copy the it to my normal music folder finally the documentation for this app sucks actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self explanatory but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident everything is very poorly explained if at all you have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own then for the few topics they offer help with it s takes you to a web page for an explanation but comically it s not a mobile friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines seriously? these are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone yet they re not in a mobile friendly format big fail ~~summary:~~~as powerful a site as amazon com is i m a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is the way it works now i find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer and transfer them to the phone manually the only time i envision using this app is when i m away from my computer and desperately want a song right away "

"4807","Amazon","so is anyone besides me upset? nay mad?","Cynthia Raxter","September 25, 2012",1,"so last year in may 2011 i got a droid loved it but the music player is lame compared to itunes i didn t care for pandora i like to play my music i hadn t discovered spotify yet i jumped on the amazon mp3 player with both feet it was not snazzy but it is functional so i upload some of my music in the 5g of space they give us for free then they say hey all music storage is free if it s mp3 then store it all here so i upload the rest of my music i am a dinosaur so have cd s from the beginning of time i have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won t ever be for sale on amazon it is all ripped into itunes and on an old ipod photo 60g so over the next few weekends i open the laptop start the amazon mp3 uploader and let it run and run and run 9000 songs later i have most of my music in the cloud and then i start pulling it down to the droid after a month i was all done then in august 2012 i get an email that amazon is pulling support from their mp3 player for music i import beyond 250 songs unless i pay 24 95 a year?even though the price is reasonable i still feel like for the first time ever amazon has done a bait and switch when they said last year 5gigs is free i used my allotment and no more when they said it s free i put some work into it and uploaded all of my music because i thought it was going to be free forever amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization so my music would be safe and the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future free i spent a month getting everything fixed perfect the playlists cleaned up dupes removed song titles entered for those homemade cds then i find find out amazon has changed their mind to the tune of 25 bucks a year just months later?and somehow i have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud now i have to re rip some cd s that have already gone into one of the cd changers i got to try and remember which albums i bought at music performances in the last year i ve got to get right with god and lucinda williams about making sure i got all that woman s music on my permanently attached electronic appendage adele is there lady gaga is there where is gillian welch s 8 albums? let see i have 2 kelly goodlad songs but am missing 4 more do i really only own one lenka song and one by robyn? this is painful p a i n f u l and that is just the girls wait until i start working on the boys i am still mad almost two months later spelling words out m a d mad? yes i am just that mad if i want to download the music from the amazon cloud drive where all my music still resides in safety but where i can not play it i have to do it one song a time and i cannot download an entire playlist i cannot access my playlist i cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time i was sold one thing it was free i worked to that end now it is not free i am usually not this cheap promise i am just that mad two other complaints: i use a netbook most of the time the cloud player and the cloud drive s web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen the artist column can not be expanded for example you can t sort by genre either i got around this by creating playlists in itunes defined as: display all with genre = rhythm and blues but yea now my playlists are gone unless i fork over 24 95 i can live with such out of free software but if you charge money it better darn tooting be nicely functional ok?last the droid app took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend i was actually able to use the player on the phone still to go through and check what i had added recently afterwards i closed the app with the task manager then the big brothers at amazon com started pushing a you must agree to this message every 10 minutes whether i was using the app or not i seriously mean i was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this amazon screen was displayed i was playing scrabble and the amazon screen took over i was performing and recording the performance and the amazon screen took over and stopped the recording i was reading email and the amazon screen took over at that point in time i deleted this app the amazon marketplace app the amazon price checker app the amazon student app the amazon shopping app and i seriously considered leaving the amazon vine program and deleting all my reviews and deleting my account here completely and totally oh my for the first time ever e v e r amazon has got on my bad side thank you for listening i am sorry for this rant i promise to be my normal happy down to earth self next year sometime yes i am just that mad "

"11726","Amazon","bug ridden release","Bhatta's Reviews","June 14, 2014",2,"i was very excited when i learnt that amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for prime members like me but my excitement did not last very long when i found several bugs limitation in this amazon music app for android granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed the most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage it is never practical to be connected to wi fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed i am sure eventually amazon will release updates to fix this until then i have really no use for it on my phone and tablets also there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer service and the downloaded songs do not play even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue currently you cannot listen or re download the songs till you clear your cache of this app if it encounters download errors you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re download again or try again and again which is very frustrating also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling the song title does not match with the song it is playing the album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs the equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on it is indeed a nice offer from amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to prime members but this app should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working app i am rating this with 2 stars currently but i am positive amazon will improve this in the future and i will revise my review accordingly thanks for reading my review "

Jones","November 4, 2016",2,"i am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if amazon fixes these issues first i will say a few positives the music selections are excellent vs what they previously offered on prime i think 7 99 for prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal second i think the iphone app is pretty good too with each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate now the cons easy things to fix:1 on the app make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song artist is playing without squinting this should be a no brainer with that said most other music apps are just as poor in this area not a good excuse though 2 the music recommendations for offline mode i have 1gb of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations it barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full so i get one playlist as a recommendation and it won t try to add more i have 2gb of space free on my device i feel like i am missing out on a big part of what i am paying for offline music now the cons harder to fix or at least very inconsistent and if you search amazon help forums others are complaining as well:3 integration with echo when i just had prime music and my own cloud library echo worked great since the release of unlimited which i accepted the free trial almost the first day echo is a wreck it started off it seemed to only shuffle my prime unlimited music that i had added to my library i had a hard time getting echo to my music i had uploaded then one day the exact opposite happened it would only shuffle music i had uploaded even worse it doesn t even shuffle on the command echo shuffle my music or shuffle songs from my cloud account on this command echo starts with the same songs until i say shuffle again and skip a song then it says enabling shuffle mode and it shuffles but the next time i do it again it picks a new different song to always start with obviously the echo/cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed it is flat out stupid how it works right now and i trust amazon is working on it at the same time i have been considering loading my 10 000 mp3s to amazon cloud for the 25 per year no way i will do that if shuffle is messed up 4 related to 3 when i do use the shuffle command it only plays songs i have uploaded it does not shuffle in any songs that i have added through prime unlimited i can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them but they will not mix in with random shuffles again a month ago this was opposite i had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play only prime songs will shuffle now it is reversed i am a big amazon fan the app issues i can mange the echo/prime music execution is poor at this time if this improves i will update my review "

"12816","Amazon","the amazon mp3 app and music ecosystem is terrible does amazon understand digital goods?","Ignatius Hsu","April 13, 2013",1,"the amazon music listening and digital purchasing experience is characterized by one word horrific skip this app save time save the 24 99 annual fee and use google music instead google music is a competing cloud service free for up to 25 000 songs and it just works it s available from the google play storethe amazon mp3 app is buggy clunky looks dated and doesn t even offer genres for browsing through your library bluetooth cuts out frequently when i listen to songs through the app on my tablet the app design says 2009 and it eschews the android holo design language for amazon s awkward kindle theme the app starts you off on a screen where you have to select store or player and it doesn t seem to remember your preference so you need to select player each time you restart the app that adds up to a lot of needless taps on your screen which disrupts your listening experience the app doesn t support genre browsing you simply cannot use your music catalogue s genres don t bother with the amazon mp3 app or amazon s music ecosystem if you do any of the following: purchase digital music consume digital music manage your music library value your sensibilities as a consumer of music the cloud service is clumsy to navigate is not truly web based you must supplement the web based cloud player with several desktop apps to complete certain actions the desktop downloader/uploader are equally as bad purchase songs and they re saved to the cloud and made available for free through amazon cloud player an ok start album art is 500px by 500px also great the rest of the amazon mp3 experience is problematic album art from purchased songs is massive a 700kb jpeg at 500px by 500px is gratuitous metadata is messy artists are not tagged correctly and amazon makes no distinction between the album artist vs artist metadata fields album titles have random words capitalized songs are inconsistently labeled i need to re tag the album metadata and update album art on my computer so much for the phone app oh wait you need to install a desktop app to download multiple mp3s and you also need adobe air and you need another desktop app to upload the updated songs you also can t push updated songs from your desktop to the cloud google music offers a seamless purchasing and listening experience is well integrated into android supports genres and follows android s design language google music does this right 25 000 songs uploaded to the cloud for free song management is almost perfect the google music app starts up in the tab you last visited so if you were in albums or artists it picks up where you left off you can purchase music but consuming it is the heart of the app amazon s mp3 player emphasizes music purchases even though most of the app s users go to it to listen rather than shop for music songs i purchase from google play have tagged file metadata correctly album art is perfect web optimized at 512px by 512px the app has genre filtering and browsing it allows you to randomize songs within a genre the cover flow is very spiffy i ve invested time in getting my album art consistent so i could browse music visually as well as through metadata i can see the effort bear fruit in this beautifully crafted app the app uses the latest android holo design language so looks consistent with the rest of the android apps it functions great and has a lock screen widget pushing updates from the desktop to the cloud is still a little challenging on google music but nothing like the 80 steps per album amazon experience you can delete an album with two clicks after that it s 6 step process you complete once per batch of updates whether it s an album or 100 albums the cloud service is truly cloud based and the user interface is elegant and intuitive like amazon mp3 you need desktop software to upload music unlike amazon mp3 in google play you can effortlessly download an entire album delete it or edit its metadata from the cloud without the need for additional desktop software the amazon mp3 app is the opposite of google music go to google play search for google music and get started with an amazing music listening experience "

"13786","Amazon","amazon mp3 hindered my 911 call for emergency help","jbru","April 16, 2012",1,"i would give this application 0 stars if that were possible it came with my sprint phone and presumably amazon paid sprint so that customers couldn t remove the application that s fine i just never used it i never bought anything i never browsed anything i never even opened the application of course that didn t stop this worthless excuse for a piece of software from downloading random updates whenever the hell it wanted; like when i was trying to do other things with the phone it also had a fun little feature where it would use 100 of the phone s processor for minutes on end i say minutes because it would often run down the battery life on my phone i would randomly throughout the week find that my phone had turned itself off due to low battery power again mind you i had never opened or used the application i endured all of this with quiet patience because while it was definitely an inconvenience i was busy and it wasn t that big of an inconvenience then then time came when i was driving and tragically a car in front of me struck a pedestrian i pulled my car over in the road to block traffic from become a danger to the injured kid who was lying in the road with a compound fracture in his right leg scrapes contusions broken teeth and most likely a nasty concussion the people driving the car that had struck the person got out and started freaking out they stood around looking panic d without a sense of direction i got out of my car and dialed 911 spotted a street address posted on a nearby building and ran over to the kid to see how bad it was meanwhile my phone stalled and i waited and waited and waited for 2 minutes and 14 seconds i waited for my phone to call 911 while i slowly started to freak out thinking i wasn t going to be able to get help for this kid in the end i did get through and managed to speak to 911 personnel get advised on what to do for the kid and made sure that the people freaking out didn t move him but for an extra 2 minutes and 14 seconds this poor kid had to lie in the street in pain saying i just want to go home over and over again later after i got off the phone with emergency personnel i looked in my phone s task monitor and histories to find out why it had taken so long to call as it turns there happened to be an application that i had never used that was for reasons unknown using 100 of the phone s processing power tell me readers which application do you suppose that was? go on guess now some of you will say that i should have rooted my phone earlier to remove the app i know right? some people actually think that it should have been necessary for me to break my phone and change settings voiding my warranty so that i could call emergency services in a timely fashion amazon mp3 was forced on me i have never used amazon mp3 i will never use amazon mp3 after that "
