"1","Spotify","spotify is great","brittkne","October 7, 2017",5,"Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It doesn't limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin  music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let's you play whole albums and let's you make custom and endless playlists."
"2","Spotify","Love this app","Vickie","July 31, 2016",5,"I love this app. I put it on my phone first, but I had so much music it was taking up all the room on my phone. I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists."
"3","Spotify","Novice","Linda Burton","April 4, 2017",5,"I love, love, love spotify !!!!! I'm 71 years and no very computer literate, if I can learn Spotify anyone can. I have found songs I used to listen to 55 years ago."
"4","Spotify","The ony music app you neec","Chris Johnson","March 7, 2017",5,"I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."
"5","Spotify","Great for metal fans!","Kindle Customer","November 13, 2017",5,"I love this app so much. I can listen to music and I can trust that the bands I like are getting paid for their work. (I use the free version so I experience the occasional ad) So much better than buying iTunes or using youtube for music. As a heavy metal fan some of the bands I like are less popular but I can find them all here. I am amazed some local and lesser known bands are featured on this service. It makes me glad that the ad revenue goes to supporting them in making more great music for my enjoyment."
"6","Spotify","BEST. MUSIC APP. EVER.","Ann Manhire","April 29, 2017",5,"Great for listening to your favorite tunes and discovering new ones as well"
"7","Spotify","I love it","Lara","April 24, 2017",5,"It is such a good app I fecomed this to anyone who love music"
"8","Spotify","Best Choice for Music","Jesse","October 14, 2017",5,"Listening to music on demand has never been better than it is with Spotify. The app not only provides access to thousands of classic tracks, but it provides great recommendations for music you might like based on your listening history. Highly recommended!"
"9","Spotify","Great app!","Amazon Customer","June 7, 2017",5,"I really like being able to pull up my favorite songs and adding them to a playlist. I also really like how it recommends new music for me based on what I already listen to."

"13","Spotify","Amazing app!","Amazon Customer","June 4, 2017",5,"This app is amazing and you don't even have to get a premium account to get access to great music!"
"14","Spotify","Better than Pandora","Jackie C","July 13, 2016",5,"I switched to Spotify from Pandora because I wanted to be able to choose the songs I wanted on my playlists while still having the option to create radio stations like on Pandora. They have a huge variety, so pretty much any song you're looking for, they'll have. The radio stations (created based on artists) tend to play a lot of the same songs over and over. I use the paid version so I don't have to listen to ads when I workout, and I'll continue to do so."
"15","Spotify","Can't live without it!!","Anna Morrison","January 8, 2017",5,"Can't live without iit!! It has opened up my musical perspectives so much & the Discovery Weekly playlist is so awesomely selected, I fell Spotify knows me!"

Goodbye pandora.","Eva Christina Gray","December 28, 2015",5,"My dad listened to spotify all the time, so I tried the free version (i have a fire tablet hd 8 edition 5) and have had no problem at all. You can download a lot of songs and listen to your own playlist, or somebody else's playlist. No more pandora for me."
"22","Spotify","Wish I could hold and drag songs/playlists to order/re-order like on the PC version but for my kindle","Amazon Customer","January 26, 2017",5,"Wish I could hold and drag songs/playlists to order/re-order like on the PC version but for my kindle. But that's nothing to lose a star over. Still the best out there."
"23","Spotify","Great Music App","Denise Pribil","October 26, 2017",5,"Great app, has every kind of music that you like. You can find a lot of great songs that you would not have found before. Also you can listen to old music or new music."

"25","Spotify","The discover playlist is your answer for new music.","Richard Huczko","February 11, 2016",5,"I don't know what to say. I'm a spotify fiend with a premium membership. I can hear anything I want and any songs that I happen to love, but the weekly discover playlist keeps me coming back because I'm incapable of finding new music on my own."
"26","Spotify","Very good app","MashyTater","April 9, 2017",5,"This is a very good app,I've used it for about 2 years now, my only issue is how often there's an ad but that won't stop you from singing in the shower!"
"27","Spotify","Best Music App","Yaritza Abdelnour","September 13, 2015",5,"This app has the most variety of music available that I have seen in any app and it is so efficient. The playlists you create can be played offline as long as you have a premium plan which, compared to other music apps, are very affordable. I would reccommend Spotify for everyone."
"28","Spotify","I fux with spotify","i.wiley","August 15, 2017",5,"My only choice for music listening"
"29","Spotify","Awesome app","Kindle Customer","July 12, 2017",5,"This app is awesomeLalalala yay yay yay yay yay yay"
"30","Spotify","Good service, great app, disappointing business model","Amazon Customer","September 8, 2015",4,"The app is great. Nice design and interface. It's easy to learn and a good service, but I would appreciate the same functionality between tablet and phone. I think it's a bit inconvenient that my phone/phablet doesn't have the same access to songs without shuffle, as a tablet does."
"31","Spotify","Best music app I've ever used.","B. Mohnkern","August 31, 2015",4,"Spotify is great, and I do have a Premium account for greater mobile listening and no ads.  My only complaint is that for unknown playlists (such as one I made) is hard for friends of mine to find unless I send them the playlist.  Small complaint, and I definitely love using Spotify."

"34","Spotify","small bug otherwise great app","Sarah","October 15, 2014",4,"There's a small issue I have a lot of times it will not allow tracks to be played or will say a track is playing, but I only hear silence. That and once it wouldn't let me share to Facebook (facebook specifically.) I haven't tried since. Great quality sound though, and I love the wide open variety. Wouldn't want an app that only has pop, rap and country :p love it"
"35","Spotify","Almost Awsome","Sally  hale","November 27, 2014",4,"I love the fact that this is free and our favorite music I shared spotify with all of my friends but here comes the negative thing tablets don't call out of state with a bid ass screen it should be music anywhere for free no internet.

"36","Spotify","Good App","mjbjn05","March 2, 2016",4,"I find that this app is better than others that I have tried. However it does seem to freeze up from time to time during songs changings I guess nothing is perfect. The download went fine with no hangups. Overall it's a good application."

"43","Spotify","Great Music App","Fan of HSS","February 19, 2016",4,"Has lots of popular songs, however I was disappointed that Taylor Swift wasn't on here.

"105","Spotify","While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical ...","Birdman","August 7, 2014",3,"While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical commercials for contemporary music.  Music sets a mood.  The commercials are such a jarring clash of genres that it destroys the mood of the music.  These interruptions are truly ill conceived.  I doubt popular music listeners would appreciate their music being interrupted by musical commercials for the Met."

But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you don't have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you're listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic.

I started off as a free user and loved Spotify even then. . . however, I have to admit that I am now a Spotify Premium user (student) and love it even more. The app works great, the Discover Weekly playlists are usually awesome and I don't regret paying for it at all. What I like about it, is that I download almost any song that I want to my devices, and then listen to it anywhere until I get play it to death and find a new favorite song. I would recommend this app to pretty much anyone, but if you're like like me you might get hooked and not be able to get away.*One important note: Spotify usually has clean radio edits of pretty much all songs but right now it doesn't have a general filter/ setting that you can use to filter. If you are offended by profanity or worried about objectionable content (and don't want to monitor it closely) that might pose a problem because beside looking at each individual song I don't know a workaround."

Other than that though, I love it!"

You can also add your own music to the player to listen to as well. Unlike Pandora, the music is on-demand so if you want to listen to en exact song or album you can. Well worth the $9.99 a month!"
"375","Spotify","Lots of music available for your listening pleasure","Gisella Patharkar","June 7, 2017",5,"This app seems amazing. However, I wonder whether artists are compensated properly. Ads are really not very intrusive. But why is there not under Amazon apps the opportunity to pay the .99 cents as a form of upgrade like with some other apps. In addition I have wondered why Amazon has changed things with regards to music. Now if I go straight to Music - Store, all I get is Prime listening stuff. I do not want to pay $10.00 a month just for listening to some music. I do like to buy tracks or CDs if I like them. I discovered one can go straight to ""shop"" and then one still has the ability to sample the tracks, or put a CD or track on your Carousel and then when they suggest other music you still can sample some tracks. I used to love  the radio app Tune-In but they also changed things and truly I wonder why. Now I no longer like that one. If something is good, please leave it alone."

It loads quickly and has all the features you need for Spotify on a tablet. Unfortunately, there are a few playback issues. Three main examples:1. Songs often skip or have annoying pops.2. When using the shuffle feature for an artist, the app seems to play the same few songs over and over (and mostly from the artist's most recent albums).3. The app often stops playing music when using another program on the Kindle. For example, if I am browsing the internet, the app sometimes quits halfway through a song and has to be restarted.Overall, this app has some challenges to overcome, but it gets the job done most of the time. After all, if I'm listening from my Kindle Fire, I'm not exactly in search of a premier audio listening experience."

However, when the trailer for “ The Visit "" came out, Spotify kept playing that trailer and it freaked me out. But just get premium if that's a problem. They have really great deals.

"592","Spotify","I did enjoy the music collections once I found them","Moose Man","January 11, 2015",2,"Unlike Pandora and Songza, once the music started on Spotify Music, I could find no obvious way to stop the app without logging-out. If there is an ""X"" or ""Quit"" it is well hidden.I did enjoy the music collections once I found them. There was quiet a variety to choose from. The sound quality was good on my Droid Turbo. The app did not always recognize my WiFi connection even when at 100% signal strength, telling me ""no internet connection.""Generally speaking I found this app to be overly complicated and lacking intuitive usage control. Yet the app has quite a following. As such I speculate it may be targeted at a demographic younger than my own.If you enjoy apps that require (in my opinion) a lot of interaction and (seem) heavily oriented to social media you may find Spotify Music worthwhile. It wasn't for me."

Somewhat","Melissa M.","July 21, 2016",3,"Now, when I first got the app about two years ago or so, it was a different app. You could listen to the songs you wanted and save them to listen to later, and listen to whatever, as long as you had WiFi (unless you had premium), and listen to sponsored apps every handful of songs. It was great.Now days, ads cut off the ending of songs, it crashes, freezes up, and you really need a premium account if you want to do anything. It seems as though they are more desperate for money, and I get that. The thing is, 10 dollars is something a lot of people might not be able to pay, yet they want to listen to music too.It's made me happy in the past, but lately it's just disappointing me."

Also it is completely free of charge unless you go premium, which turns off ads and lets you listen offline. You can even listen to music as you read or play games or whatever you do on your mobile device. Way better than Pandora or other music services like that.

Or the ad video gets stuck and the time keeps going and once the time runs out everything stops and the only way I've figured out to fix it is by deleting the app, downloading it again, and logging back in.

Any time I have used Spotify since its beta, I can't help but think that it is designed to keep you from its main purpose; listening to music. Finding artists albums and songs are easy enough, but listening to the music is frequently interrupted with adverstisements (much more often than like services such as Pandora). The music also stops playing on many of my devices when in standby mode after a random amount of time for some reason. In my opinion it focuses too much on being easy and loses much of what I want from a music player in the process."

"1497","Spotify","Disappointing functionality, terrible stock playlists/stations.","Albie","August 29, 2016",2,"Was pretty excited to finally nut up for a paid music service after using standard Pandora free since it came out almost 10 years ago.  I was attracted to Spotify for the offline playback, since I lIke listening to music while camping and traveling in the backcountry miles away from cell service.  I started downloading all my favorite music, making playlists, and using the app right away.  I was never in love with the radio, and browse functions, as they felt clunky and not very intuitive. But i was making my own playlists so that didnt bothet me too much.  All was working well until it wasn't.  First the radio and browse functions started working even more poorly and then not at all, then Spotify would freeze up, and I'd have to close the app occasionally and restary.  Then Spotify would freeze my phone to where I would have to remove the battery to restart. Thankfully I can do that with my phone.  It still works fairly well when its actually working, but it freezes too often. The soft buttons to navigate through the features are too close and mistakes can be made too easily for efficient ""party dj"" type playback.  The stock radio stations have a ton of crappy filler music so you need to rely on making your own playlists, and I use the app out of service so I admittedly have hundreds of songs ""saved"" to my phone which may be causing the freezing, still unaccpetable. But that is only half of my gripe.  Navigation is awkward and the app is in need of remodel.  I think they employ millenials to put together playlists, I haven't found a decent one yet. I was truly excited for this app but sadly I most likely will cancel if things aren't improved."

Also, on the web I don't have ads due to spotify rewarding me for helping with bug fixes or being member since prebeta, or something. It wasn't really specified as to why I shouldn't have ads with my account, but I still get th on mobile app.  Another issue is that I can't find an option to use better sound quality when on WiFi. I get the crap audio on 4g eating up my data cap, but I have a nice phone and would like better quality music when it's viable through high-speed internet.  The app kinda sucks, and the web player still seems to be the best option across most platforms, but at least they thought of us Amazon users."

Spotify gives me access legally to a massive range of my favorites and beyond. I have innumerable playlists, making them specific to any event in my home, or activity. For example, I have playlists for 32-minute workouts. I don't remember why, but it made sense at the time.So to review this, readers need first to distinguish Spotify from the competition, like Pandora. Pandora has its place, but what Spotify allows me to do is choose individual songs (in general). I used to buy more music on iTunes, but no longer do. The only time I buy a CD now is when it is extremely local.As far as the app is concerned, I use it on a Kindle Fire. Basically, it is one of the few Fire apps that works just as it does on my Android phone. I use the free version for now, without the paid subscription, so I still hear commercials, and, while using it on a mobile device, do not get to hear my playlists in the order in which I intended.

The one thing that annoyed me about the app was, when you played a playlist that was small (Less than 17 songs?), it would start throwing in random songs, as though you'd created a radio station. Which, why? Why the hell would you do that? Occasionally I'll make a playlist with a single song because, well, that's how I roll, but I could not get them to play without the ""suggested"" songs popping up and I could not figure out a work-around. It was pretty disappointing. Other than that though, as far as functionality goes, it seemed fine. My problem was that after several weeks I tried to open it one day and got a message that there wasn't enough storage space on the tablet. Which was a dirty lie. The only thing I use my tablet for is listening to music and surfing porn and how much space does that take? But try as I might all I could get was an error message or a blank screen. In a fit of pique I deleted the app and then downloaded it again. And it was fine. Perfectly functional. For several days and then it did it again. I deleted, reinstalled, rocked out for a couple days and then, boom, same thing again. And after doing this a few times I just gave up and installed Pandora. Possibly the problem is me. Or my tablet, which is neither terribly expensive nor a big-name brand. Or the app could be tragically fatally flawed. I mean, who knows? Regardless though, it's still worth a try. Because when it works, Spotify beats pretty much anything else on the market."

"2980","Spotify","Spotify is the gift of music in its entirety","RexRaiger","September 3, 2014",5,"I grew up with a turntable, reel to reel tape and AM radio, then marveled when FM and cassette tapes rocked my world with improved sound and portability.  CDs upped the ante.  MP3s, portable digital players and satellite radio further extended content and quality.  Then something wonderful happened and changed everything: enter Spotify.Spotify’s paid subscription delivers ad-free all you can eat music with every song you can think of and access to every genre old and new.  Combine that with phenomenal quality and universal streaming access via any smart device – PC, smart TV, streaming media player, tablet and smartphone – and musical nirvana is mine.In practice, Spotify can be quite daunting.  What genre, group, album or song would I like to listen to now or download to my device for later?  Spotify makes answering this question easier with options for matching your mood or activity with playlists supplied by Spotify experts and other users as well as searching and browsing tools that deliver clear results with helpful, relevant recommendations.The Spotify experience plays out differently across each of my typical use cases – desktop PC with near-field monitor speakers, tablet with Bluetooth connection to living room home theater sound system and smartphone with Bluetooth connection to car stereo or wireless headphones – but each one delivers exceptional results.Frankly, exploring Spotify on a 24 inch desktop computer display and hearing the results on studio-quality monitors pointed at each ear is thrilling.  This is where I can truly grasp even the finest musical nuances and how I can accurately judge Spotify’s streaming media as excellent.Spotify on my 8.9 inch Kindle HD adds a novel musical dimension to sitting on the living room couch or hanging in the kitchen with family and friends, enabling one and all to queue their favorites, contributing background or central focus for conversation.  Handing the Bluetooth connected tablet to a newcomer often requires a few moments for instruction on finding and queueing tunes that benefit from my home theater’s surround sound with subwoofer speakers.  Recently, I introduced a friend with a room-sized, wall to wall audio collection to Spotify, who said this tablet solution could, should and would replace his shelves and stacks with instant musical gratification.Smartphone Spotify brings an endless mobile musical mix to the gym and in the car.  In both cases, I typically rely on a quick search for a favorite group or mood-matching playlist, then get moving.  My Bluetooth headset’s controls make it easy to pause, skip or replay tunes playing on the Spotify app without touching my phone.  On the road with my smartphone connected to the car stereo via Bluetooth, the Spotify app’s big Shuffle Play button makes moving past less desired tracks effortless while maintaining the spontaneity akin to broadcast radio.While all these options for consuming music are first rate, the most important service feature remains Spotify’s monumental breadth and scope.  The collection offered by Spotify fulfills my dual desires for deep diving in my musical past as well as expanding my horizons."

I have NEVER paid for the  upgrade or Premium Service of ANY APP before until now.  I was lucky enough to get in on a 90 day free trial for Spotify over the holidays and like WOW!!  In a few days, my free trial will end and I fully intend to subscribe to the paid Premium Service, not just for me, but my whole family.  The free version needs to offer a little more freedom so people can really see how fantastic Spotify really is.  If you do a free trial, anything less than a Premium subscription is just a tease and actually depressing."

I'm NOT the one to be rating this app.  I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes.  In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded.So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow.  MUSE.  The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs.  The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies)  So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group.  hahaha.  Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues.  And sounded pretty good with earphones on.  So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt."

I am able to listen to anything past or present, I have yet to search an artist that they don't have, believe me, I have tried.

I was also disappointed with that.2. You can't play individual songs. Ok so this is how it works, you search a song and you can add it. That song you can now out in a playlist. A playlist is just where you can categorize songs. And when you see the list of all your songs, you can't just play one. You must shuffle play. I WAS REALLY UPSET WITH THIS!! RREEAALLY UPSET!3. They don't have all songs, but they do have most.4. I JUST WISH YOU DONT HAVE TO SHUFFLE PPLLAAYY!5. There is way more to Spotify, like radio and stations and things like thatTHANKS FOR READING I HOPE YOU CAN EASILY MAKE YOUR DECISION (I hope Spotify reads this and fixes the shuffle play problem. I'm sorry Taylor Swift fans, I don't think Taylor Swift allows Spotify to use her songs, it's a money /business issue. -thank you-"

I love how they have almost every song and artist you can think of! I personally don't have premium, but I still use my Spotify at least and hour a day. You can get everything from the original, to remixes, to the live versions of a ton of songs. I have everything from 1D to  for King and Country! I love Spotify and think it is epic! Once I got my Spotify, I quit Pandora and eventually deleted the app. Spotify is amazing and I would definitely recommend getting it!!!"

As a dancer and dj, I have over 100,000 titles on my hard drive, but almost all of them can be found on Spotify as well, and streamed in high definition.  They can also be played offline on my laptop so I can take my playlist to any location, whether it has wifi or not.  I can share the playlists publicly to my dancers and fellow dj's.  I can add to my Local Files the albums it does not have, as long as I have them in my collection on the given computer or network, or purchase them elsewhere.  It is user friendly and cost efficient.  The artists get paid by the use of their music, per play, which seems fair-ish, at 7/10 of a cent per play: great if you are a superstar, not so great if you are a budding artist, but, hey, I can FIND budding artists on Spotify that I never would never know about if it weren't for their similar artist and radio functions, so all is fair and ethical, as far as I can see.  Those artists that stand the test of time get paid ultimately more than those that are a flash in the pan. Hat's off to Spotify!"

"5585","Spotify","Great. Ehh. Resentment....","Rashad","December 6, 2015",4,"I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I'd be infamous by now.I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips (mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user) I ran into the same skip limit as if I didn't shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks (this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I'd start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill) and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day (I Guess This Is What We Call) Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's & 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. That's what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that's how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There weren't enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that's just based off the experiences I've read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let's say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would've gotten a bigger Kindle (external memory wise). What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. (coughs) Pandora (coughs). In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX 8. You can't really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it's only $12.99/month. What's that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I'll pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it's features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can't go wrong."

It was a little misleading though as I thought it was a full app for the TV. I expected it to work much like the app on my tablet or phone where you can see the playlists and all that right within the app. But how this works is that you play your music on another device like your phone or desktop and you can broadcast it over your TV. It works, but I don't like that I need to use a 2nd device to change the songs, etc. Also, sometimes the connection isn't stable even when the internet connection is perfect. For the most part it's ok, but I think app could use some work.I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews! If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a ""Yes"" vote on my review!"

"5871","Spotify","wonderful except for compatibility issues","Gayle Galor","November 19, 2014",4,"I first downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation and it worked perfectly. It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it's absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon isn't to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they're even sure that the app works, then they shouldn't complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info.Bottom line - it's an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it's one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you don't have to listen to a whole lot of music that you don't want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it's still worth it. The premium version is $9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again."

"5884","Spotify","The sound quality is great (not excellent","Della","August 14, 2014",4,"I use this on a daily basis. The sound quality is great (not excellent, but still a nice quality sound for most songs). There are very few songs I have not been able to find on Spotify, and I suspect that has something to do with the individual artists' licensing agreements. Unlike other music services, I don't have to listen to any songs I don't want to, and when using the non-mobile version, there are no limits to the number of times I can skip songs. I merely have to listen to a short (around 30 seconds) advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs.The drawbacks are that some songs are not available, and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app, you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device, and that even includes iPads and tablets. Still, if you are using a laptop or desktop, it is probably the best free music app available at this time, and you can't beat the price."

"5940","Spotify","Spotify Is Great!","A. Ebel","September 15, 2014",5,"Very great source for music and programming to listen to while you're at home or on the go.  I do recommend that you use this only at home since it might run up your limited data plan.  The sound quality is above CD quality and the service has a very good library.  It beats filling up your phone with songs and ending up running out of space.  Spotify does not have everything and sometimes they limit what you can listen to based where you are located because of those copyrights.  I have the premium subscription because I hate the commercials in the middle of the listening sessions."

However, I HAVE used it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app.  It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well.  Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums.  Very nice.  Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now.  One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free.  It does have a few commercials, VERY few.  It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining.  Really nice service or app or whatever you call it.  I think it's great!!!"

"6002","Spotify","Things to be worked on","TruePhantom","April 23, 2016",4,"Spotify is a great app for listening to your favorite songs. Being able tomake playlists that have songs you already like gives it a slight edge over Pandora. Since both are free and use ads to allow yoyu to not have subscription it really comes down to whether you feel knowing what songs are going to play versus getting introduced to new songs you might like. While Spotify does both, it doesn't really do the latter as often, where Pandora is entirely that. Really it comes down to personal preference and what you are looking for. If you want to know what is going to play based on a playlist you created go with Spotify, but if you want more of a radio deal go Pandora. Both have things they could improve on. Now as for both apps' premium upgrades Spotify, in my opinion, has more bang for your buck. You have the ability to skip and amount of songs,peak and see what is up next, have no ads, and download songs or playlists to your device for offline listening. This means you don't have to have signal nor do you have to use so much data. In my own opinion Spotify and Pandora are great apps for the type of music provider they are. Honestly if you can't choose between them, get both! If you already do and what to go premium on one go with Spotify, because it offers more in my opinion, although it is more expensive than Pandora."

Music quality is a big issue for me, but this app has the best quality I've ever had on a free app. The only thing I really dislike about it is the fact that you can't change the EQ on a kindle fire. I tap on it and gives me a warning saying something about different EQ settings can change volume level and then closes! Why can't I change the EQ?!? I can on my IPod!"

Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

All your excuses go out the window now!On Amazon, compared to Itunes or Google Play, Spotify let's you CHOOSE the song. It lets you CREATE playlists. It lets you SHARE the song...Spotify has done an excellent job. Although Amazon seems to suck for not having the top app and games like Clash of Clans, everyone can find a way to do that. But exclusively to Amazon, Spotify gave its users the abilities that no other app store is capable of.All the negative reviews are lies. It's probably something the user did to their device over time(you know what I'm talking about).I totally recommend this app. Free music for life! Not very many ads, either, which is nice.Enjoy!"

"8447","Spotify","this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating ...","Michael Henry","October 23, 2014",5,"Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists.  Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music.  I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick.  If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you.  If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists.  Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc.  (I recommend the paid version) If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.Happy Listening Spotifyers!Cheers!"

I use this app every single day and I love making various playlists of my favorite musicians and artists. I also love that I can find new music and bands within the same genres, which has turned me on to new music and indie artists that I never would have known about without Spotify. Now I can support these artists by buying merchandise, CDs and going to their concerts. Another cool feature is that you can listen to music offline by downloading the songs to your PC. This means that you can download music to your device at ho,e using your WiFi instead of using up all of your mobile data streaming the songs when you are out. You have to get this app. Spotify rules. It is ABSOLUTELY WORTH GETTING A PRO SUBSCRIPTION!!! It is $9.99 a month, but it is worth it. SPend the money!!! You will not regret it."

The only thing missing is the ability to easily move a song from one of my playlists to another. Adding a ""Move to"" option in the drop down menu of each song would be a big plus.

I decided to go for it, as I don't have a very big music collection . It has completely changed my relationship to the music world, although I'm worried that I'm no longer listening to radio at all . They have practically everything I ever look for , and with premium you get excellent quality and no ads . HOWEVER I do think they could do a better job with the Kindle interface , giving you more options for how to organise your library , for example. Mine is getting quickly out of control!"

You can create your own playlists or choose from many already set up. Spotify can be used in your computer with no loss of selections made. There are 30 second commercials. There is a prime version that is commercial free.  I find it easier to set up playlists and albums to listen to on my computer. Not certain about battery drain, it seems the steaming audio could use up battery life rather quickly. I have been using Spotify on my computer for several years and am happy to have a portable version available."

The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like.The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that's better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album ( suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there )"

"9092","Spotify","People don't understand this amazing app.","Onyx","December 15, 2014",5,"This app is simply amazing. It's musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a ""station"" or ""mix"" and that feature is decent. The algorithms aren't great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that don't want to pay for premium service, you don't have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I'm aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you don't need to pay $9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they don't email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I've had my account for 5 months and I don't think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. :)"

Now it's basically Pandora, which sucks. You choose, skip, or listen to a song when you want to. Unless you pay a whopping $10 monthly ($520 a year!), all you can do is shuffle play one genre. That's it. So dumb."
"9174","Spotify","Needs to update it's music","The Blockheadz","March 29, 2017",4,"I'm listening to Spotify as I write this, and as a whole it's a good app, even with the new update. There is just one minor problem, their music library is somewhat lacking. Don't take it the wrong way, they have tons of songs and such, but some of the things they call singles are actually quite large albums. I don't appreciate it when I find a song on something like Pandora and want to listen to it again, only to find the album on Spotify has every song except the one I am looking for. Other then that, it's a good music app."

I ended up downloading a few songs and making a playlist, and then I went through a few &#34;top 50&#34; stations and added some more songs.  Then its putting in songs on my library that I didn't add, saying recommended song. I want to listen to the songs I added, not some songs that suck that have nothing to do with the type of music I listen to. I just wish it was set up better also. Its really hard to find anything on there, and it gets really frustrating. I also hate that it shuts down right when I open it up. I just hope they fix the bugs soon."

ITS FREE (unless you upgrade to the premium) Honestly, I am thinking about upgrading to premium myself, bc it just has a ton of cool qualities.. For one, I think that downloading the playlists of songs of your choice, and being able to listen to it WITHOUT WiFi, is THE BEST THING EVER!!!It's just THT it's on premium.. :/ but the free version is practically amazing in every way except that ONE thing....********GeT tHiS aPp RiGhT nOw!¡!¡!¡!¡!"

I do not yet understand computers well and Spotify regardless, brings mevery good music. Spotify also has shown me how to better understand types of grouping I wouldn't have thought of! I very much appreciate the Premiums option of increased digital audio quality and ability to easily interface with useful software currently, I can and often do listen to Spotify music using Jriver mc 19 either, via headphone or preamplifier, There are many such Software options available as trial for you to learn more about music and computer audio. These points are a very basic starting group for Spotify. If you are as new to computer audio as Iam, enjoy and slowdown. Lee McDonald a.k.a.GREENSIDEUP"

Maybe there's something I'm doing wrong, but if I play my downloaded songs, even they have commercials every 3 songs. (I suppose I could pay to upgrade and maybe I'd lose the ads, but I'm not willing to do that, as I don't listen to music constantly - or enough to pay a subscription price to go without ads.  I'd rather buy a CD if that's the case).  I don't like the  Playlist Radio, because it plays songs that are nothing like the playlist.  It's irritating.  The info says that Spotify gets to know what you like, but I have zero Abba songs (and nothing like that on my playlists), but yet what songs do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist?  Some idiocy by Abba, of course.  I suppose I was too optimistic in hoping that Spotify was like using your MP3 or iPod.  I guess they have to make money somehow.  Still, I do enjoy being able to play (somewhat without interruption) a grouping of songs I have chosen."

There are ways to get around the shuffle limitation (really, Spotify? Really?) but I shouldn't have to deal with that. I realize that I'm not paying, but I shouldn't have to be. Spotify is not a radio app and should not ever act like one. It downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD, synced up my music beautifully once logged in, and as always most of the music I could ever want. I don't mind the ads, that's what premium is for. But again, the shuffle-only issue, and it refused to sync again to accommodate the playlist changes I made online, and said 'no internet connection' even when I had WiFi and my other apps had no problem with the WiFi. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled, but this time I got a different Spotify, even though it was the same app in the store. I think it was the premium version even though I never knowingly paid. It was fantastic - but I'm worried they might have charged me, so I uninstalled. It may have been some kind if free trial, but when I first reinstalled it told me there was a payment issue in the store, so I just tried again. If they charge me, I will raise hell, but as usual Spotify is (in my experience) an amazing app."

Just recently I was trying to pick a song to listen to( I don't listen to music often) only to be met with no song playing. I kept clicking the same song and noticed that every time I click a song the shuffle button twitches a little bit. So I then Clicked the shuffle button and voila it worked..? Not the song I wanted. It refuses To play songs I click on, it says &#34;only with spotify premium can you do this&#34;..... I've never had a problem with this and was always able to listen to any song I want when I click it. I'm really upset :( I thought spotify was one of the Best apps out there but now I feel frustrated, and something I trusted to go to, to listen, to relax, to have fun with is now going to Have to cost money..? ..well I'm not paying, your just going to have to accept my dissappointment as payment. :("

I do still have adds though but that's not that bad.Cons: 1. The premium cost ten dollars a month! I'm nine and I know that's expensive!2.I know this isn't Spotify fault but Taylor Swift took her music off of Spotify and I'm one of her fans! Thank you for reading!"

"10053","Spotify","Not Worth It","Nerdy101","September 11, 2015",2,"I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can't choose what song you want to listen to (it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play) and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can't exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can't see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it's a song you don't like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/"

"10133","Spotify","Okay","Caity C.","October 9, 2015",3,"The app is a great app,  my problem is how they have made this upgrade to purchase the premium package just to listen music.  It hasn't been like this,  and it was perfect before they made all of these exasperating  changes.  I do not like the fact that I cannot listen to the song I want to listen to,  I hate this shuffle play because it  will take albums and songs from other albums that I do not want to hear and put with the album,  and it gets on my nerves.  When I want to listen to &#34;Freak&#34; or &#34;Honeymoon&#34;  by Lana Del Rey,  I have to hear other songs of her with remixes  that ruin her beautiful songs.  It annoys me very much. I hope spotify gets my complaint  and decides to make a change. When I want to upgrade,  it doesn't me  me.  Soo,  Spotify doesn't want me to be happy.  Most of the Music  apps are on Kit Kat  4.1 (Android)  and iOS 7-9 (Apple)  and I have a Kindle."

I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through what I just went through .Best wishes"

You can discover (or rediscover) all kinds of great music. The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can't really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it's not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips."

I recommend you to use this music app. Trust me you'll love this app, so I encourage you to switch to Spotify. It`s an incredible app, especially if you have a premium account. There`s an immense number of selections to pick from; pop, latino, rock, country and so on. Another thing you can do if your a premium user is skip songs an infinite number of times, and pick the song your heart desires to hear.There's a number of things you can do. If you're a music lover I totally recommend this app to you. Even if you're not a premium user you'll automatically fall in love with this app, you'll be blinded by your love for music. Likewise, you'll be attached to it.The only difference of not being a premium user is not having the freedom to skip songs, and make your own selection of music. Otherwise it's beyond phenomenal."

On kindle it lets you pick any track. but listening on my android phones sucks. Because you can't pick any tracks . you can just pick songs ,  but the downside it plays a random track and also plays songs that aren't on your playlist. But on kindle you don't have that problem. I give it 4.9 stars out of 5 for listening on kindle. And 2/5 stars on android phone. I don't know how it work on apple. But on kindle I love it."

One thing I don't like is that sometimes when you have a song downloaded, it will change to a different version. ie:I've had ""Walk the Line"" by Johnny Cash downloaded on a playlist for a long time, then one time when i was listening to that playlist and it played that song, it was a live version, rather than the one i had initially downloaded. This has happened a few times with other songs. They would switch to covers, instrumentals, or live versions. Other than that, I love everything about this app."

"10765","Spotify","This is genius!","Anastasiya Markina","July 22, 2015",5,"Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!"

"10887","Spotify","Best Music App Out There For Streams!","Missy K.","June 8, 2016",5,"Spotify is my main source of music. It is available on every device including Roku, and has the ability to put together play lists. I used to download mp3s and it took hours of my life transferring them onto devices or cds. I had to pick one track out of entire albums constantly, and it was a pain. I am an early adopter of Spotify and the Internet in general. I remember when Yahoo Music came out. I was there for the controversial Napster, and the embracing of mp3 as a legal format to sell albums on iTunes.Spotify could stand to give a bit more back to artists, but I love I pay a monthly fee and can support musicians just by listening as usual. I love it has a high quality play back mode and an offline mode for when you lose service. I still think it's important to purchase music, but as a culture streaming will be vital to the new model being built in the music industry.Spotify links to last.fm accounts for charting your music,  you can add local files to it, and it has great Playlist choices, recommendations from friends, stations, and more. If you're a music lover you will love this app as you have much more control over what you listen to, and is great at helping you discover new music! While supporting artists.I highly recommend to anyone who doesn't already have Spotify. It's my daily driver, my go to, my happy place. I've been using it since it came out and I am ever grateful for it in my life. I just upgraded to a family plan so everyone can enjoy and make their own play lists.I'd also like to add the app is smart. If you have it running at home the  use it on your device it will switch to the new device seamlessly. Pretty cool right?I think so!"

Hmm....Also, not thrilled I can't listen to the song my husband put on there, ""Chicken Surprise"" by Brad Price, unless I upgraded to premium?!?! Quite a scam there I am was thinking...Hmmmm....But, went with the 7 days free trial and they said no charge after, it will just revert to the original afterwards unless you're with Sprint, so we'll see...."

It also has a bunch of different music indie, dubstep, metal, rock, rap, emo, pop, Mozart, alternative (my favorite), and more! In a nutshell, if you like music but don't want to spend your money on discs and other things like that, you'll love this. Best thing is it's free! All you need is an internet.connection."

You are able to listen to all you favorites, make playlists, and brows music you would have never found without Spotify. I like to use the menu on a song to start a radio station around that song, then use the thumbs up or thumbs down to personalize the sounds I like. I love being able to download certain songs/playlist/ albums in order to use the offline mode that doesn't take any data from my limited plan.

Maybe you could add a select button so that we could select many songs at once, and then it would be easier to add to playlists. Another thing you could add, is making it so you could see how many songs you have all together, and not just in the playlistsThanks"

And with only a couple dollars you can listen to your music offline as well. When you first create your account you get a month of free skips and other premium features. Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app."

(Though if you kept skipping chances are that you get an advertisement) Also, you were able to see the songs that were coming on next.After (now): You cannot select whatever song you want to play. Which REALLY sucks. I always loved Spotify on kindle because you could pick a song. Now you can't put songs on queue or see what songs are going to play next. I always liked looking at the songs coming on next.The update was just today. (9/9/15) I feel so upset.*The only thing that kept the same THANKFULLY is the ability to replay ONE song over and over again.I want to kinda give up Spotify and just have Pandora since Spotify isn't very useful and takes up sooo much space. But I have some very good playlists.I'm so very unhappy. I understand why they might have done that however I can't afford premium. It's not worth it. ):"
"11268","Spotify","Five Stars","Amazon Customer","October 1, 2014",5,"Great"
"11269","Spotify","Meh","Kittycat cp","November 22, 2016",4,"Some covers the artists, like nightcore, are not on there and some of the songs are not available unless you pay for premium. Lots of ads, but there are also times where you can get up to a half hour of ad free music. They don't have actual radio stations either. You can make playlists and while not all the music is available, there is a wide variety. You need a decent WiFi connection or it won't work that well. Searches are kind of irritating because you look up a song and it shows cds, artists, and songs with related or same words. It also doesn't have the option to delete/deactivate your account. Overall, it is only great if you spend money to buy premium, but is a decent source of music if you have WiFi."

You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind, and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let's face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan, such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!"

I do strongly recommend that there should always be clean versions of all content instead of just some. on iTunes, the user can pick to see Clean or Explicit versions of songs. They should have this on Spotify too. Or maybe they could just have a clean versions alongside the explicit version.Also there should be an alarm clock feature. If there already us it should be easier to find. If there is not, please add it!Thanks Spotify!"

I love the ""related artists"" sections provided, that let's me explore even more bands  I just hope I have enough time, left here on earth, to hear it all. Also having the ability to play your music on pretty much any device you can think of is great. Keep up the good work. Worth every penny of my subscription."

U DO need Wi-Fi for the app to work.. but when u are connected it works perfectly. I'd give this app 100 (or more) if possible anyways...all in all.... this app is amazing for anything.

Also great for relaxed order of songs and if you're ok with limits to skips.I myself have grown tired of pop songs and needed more remixes and smaller songs that never find their way to the top 40.In summary, Compared to apps like rdio and Pandora it's a big one up for pop songs, but if you're after smaller artists sound cloud is the way to go."
"11358","Spotify","Internal error","LGjr","August 12, 2017",2,"The app would not work on my Samsung S6 edge +.It loaded with no problem but when I tried to start it it gave me an internal error and wouldn't run. I would like to use it but can't."
"11359","Spotify","New Update","Kindle Customer","September 10, 2015",2,"This app was probably the best music app until their new update. Before I had probably around one thousand songs and could listen to any of them in whatever order I wanted to, but because of the update you can't take shuffle, play more than one song at a time, or skip songs without buying premium. This is incredibly inconvenient, and there are some songs I simply can't play anymore. Now if you want to play a song you have to set it on shuffle, so it chooses a random song (usually not the one I want) and stays on the song until I get frustrated and try to play another song from another album. If you get this app then I would buy premium because it is a good app; it's just a crappy update."
"11360","Spotify","AMAZING but.....","GetDisAppDoe","November 30, 2015",4,"Well, my friend had this app for a little while on her IPhone, and she LOVED it. Sometimes she used it without wifi, and it ate up all of her data. I have a kindle, and it's either me or it makes everything else.... slow. I'm worried it'll use up my data too. Besides that, it's pretty great. So...... overall, I recommend it for extreme music lovers who only want THEIR music played. The ability to create your own playlist (for free) with any music is my kind of heaven. Thank you Spotify!"
"11361","Spotify","beautiful","fortefied19","August 7, 2014",5,"It works really well when u have  a book and u like music and like me I like all the music that I listen too"

"11363","Spotify","its okay","Melina medina","December 20, 2015",3,"I said I s okay because at first when I got I was so happy because now I could listen to music which is my favorite thing to do so I downloaded it to my iPhone but when I clicked a song it would play another song and I found that very anoyoing and once I was going to show one of my friends a song but it played another very inappropriate song and I tryed to quickly turn it of however when I use spotifiy on my iPad it always plays the  song that I want to hear it always plays that song but then there's an add for the premium and it would all of a sudden glitch now I don't know if its my only my iPhone or its spotifiy but it is so frickin annoying"
"11364","Spotify","great for lazy Sunday's and parties alike.","Kindle Customer","June 25, 2016",4,"Putting aside the whole ethical debate over artist's royalties+spotify, this app is great. Easy to use and everything comes in crystal clear; it turns my kindle into a jukebox at parties and get-togethers. It even has a great selection of some of the more obscure songs and albums that are next-to-impossible to get physical copies of. Again, judging the app, not the ""musician vs spotify"" debate. That said, definitely recommended!"
"11365","Spotify","Get Premium, its worth it......for some","kd320","August 20, 2016",5,"Spotify has replaced my iTunes.Now, some people may think that paying monthly for a music service is pointless, however, there are benefits to this service.Not only do you get the benefits of skipping as many songs as you want, you are able to control all the music as if it were your ipod/mp3 player. The ability to search for a song you just heard on the radio and add it to your song library at that very moment is awesome. If you keep up with new music and have an extensive love for music this will be worth it.If you're already purchasing and download more than 10+ songs a month you'll save money with this service."
"11366","Spotify","Love it!","Dana","June 4, 2016",5,"I honestly love this application so much. In my opinion, it's the best one out there. Although there are a few artists and songs that I can't find on this platform, on the whole it's easy to create playlists, follow your favorite artists, and stream music. Amazing for any music lover."
"11367","Spotify","Decent, but not perfect.","Janet in ND","September 14, 2015",3,"I really like the idea, and I have a wonderful playlist of songs I like, but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played. A little frustrating."
"11368","Spotify","Perfect song app","Monique Ogden","August 5, 2016",5,"You can find just about any song that you can imagine. Rock, rap, metal, edm, it's all here. Great loading times on the kindle. Just a few ads for non premium users, but it's more than worth it for freedom in your music. A must download for any human that likes music."
"11369","Spotify","Great for Phone without an FM Tuner!","martialartist","July 22, 2016",5,"Spotify is easy to use and works great when you do not have an FM tuner chip in your phone. I have the Samsung Galaxy S4 and of course I would own the one without the FM tuner chip so radio apps will not work  I like this because I can play an artist, genre or a decade!"
"11370","Spotify","spandora","annisboys","September 14, 2015",2,"Will not let you choose what song you want to play. For a little while it will let you get addicted to it, but after that it takes those privileges away. It makes you put it on shuffle and makes you wait for the song you want to come on. Spotify will not even let you listen to just that album, it will insert &#34;suggested&#34; songs every other song. Unless you pay 10.00 a month, Spotify is not much better than Pandora. Spotify will also sometimes get stuck on an add and you will have to shut down your device to restart Spotify and continue to play music. In summary it is just as worth it to get the free version of Pandora as the free version of Spotify."
"11371","Spotify","Best Music Streaming Service!","Chris Seljestad","July 24, 2015",5,"Spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over Pandora any day, you can listen to full albums (heck, even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to!) from all your favorite artists / bands!If you buy the Spotify Premium Service, you're able to listen to your music - commercial free."

It was basically the best and probably one of the most used music app. Lately I noticed that there have been a lot of updates of the app. Now who wouldn't love New updates to one of their favorite app?Now I can't skip songs more than 5 times in a row, if I want to I have to upgrade to premium. I guess a lot of people aren't upgrading to premium, so now they are making less and less features of the app available for free. Now I don't mind listening to ads, and trust me they do play along of ads back to back after listening to about 5-6 songs."

(So far) there is no better application to listen to music on. I highly recommend Spotify. It is MUCH better than other musical apps because it has all the music you could ever want. Including letting you make endless amounts of playlists (which I personally LOVE). If you are looking for a good app to play music on, then download this application."
"11379","Spotify","Stream vs Storage.","John Harp","September 14, 2016",5,"I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they didn't have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to $1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I don't need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I couldn't find something on Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it's made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them."
"11380","Spotify","Could not upload audio CD data","Alan Samuels","July 18, 2016",2,"We were motivated to update our online library when we got our Echo, because songs from our library are available on request with the device.  Unfortunately, it appears that there is no way to upload data from an audio CD (from our physical home library).  It may be that there is a way to do this, but we were unable to figure out how to do so.  In iTunes, it is simply a matter of inserting an audio CD while the application is running.  In addition, there is evidently a 250 song limit on the number of songs you can upload into the Spotify cloud database, unless you are willing to pay ten bucks a month to upgrade the service."
"11381","Spotify","okay but it could be better","Sarah Neil","May 11, 2016",4,"It is actually very useful for listening to music and podcasts. The thing is, although it has many songs you might not always find the song you're looking for. Yet, the format is very neat, organized, and easy to use. But, once again, there is a little problem that I have experienced. Every once and awhile, I will be listening to music, with my volume turned up and my headphones on, but there won't be any sound. It will say that the song is playing, but you can't here it. This has caused me to have to delete and redownload the app many times. Nevertheless, this is a very good app, and hopefully you won't have any glitches."

"11384","Spotify","Get it. Srsly","Gil Franklin","February 17, 2016",5,"Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist, instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also, the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists, in case you're wanting to just have it on while you're working or working out. Just have the free version, thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about."

You should stick with Pandora."
"11388","Spotify","Change it back!!!","Kindle Customer","November 30, 2015",4,"I started out with this app a few months ago. It was the best one I had so far. Soon after I got it though, they updated it to where only &#34;premium subscribers&#34; could listen to any song they want without having to shuffle a playlist. I miss that version and want more for us free subscribers! I get you have to make money a somwhere, but come on! Don't tease us for a bit, then take it away. Other than that, a pretty decent app."
"11389","Spotify","It would have been wayyyyy better","Tyeve28","August 16, 2016",3,"Ugh there ok, I got premium for free for three months, but after a couple off weeks I would play about three songs in a row, and the song stops playing and I would constantly have to press play.

Get that fixed and then I'll think about purchasing Premium."

The adsI just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes ""The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors.""I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.But I can't play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load (Which sucks a lot since I'm a music lover)Sometimes if I'm LUCKY!

Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I'm not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!"

I play the worship music playlist to help encourage me throughout the day and to edify my faith.  I also liked to play it during the lab courses I taught to make the classes go smoothly and quickly.  Spotify has a huge selection of all genres of music. It is worth the monthly fee to have this selection of music at my fingertips."

"11414","Spotify","Try something else","Serry","January 9, 2015",2,"Desktop Spotify is great: nearly every song ever at your fingertips. Mobile Spotify is a different story. 90% of the time, I use Spotify when I'm out and can't access my computer, and the shuffle play function sets my teeth on edge. It's less shuffle and more like radio, since it throws in the occasional recommended artist here and there. The idea of going ad-free, offline functionality, and unlimited skips is plenty of incentive to buy the premium version, but the shuffle feature less makes me want to go premium and more makes me want to delete the app and possibly punch something."

And I could choose a song,I still had adds bit I didn't have to just shuffle. Then one day the app updated and my kindle was recognised as a mobile device and I can only shuffle. So I just got tired of only getting recommended songs.I just use YouTube or Soundcloud even Pandora."

Why does this happen? I can be enjoying a real good song that I added to my up next listen and minutes later, it just shifts songs, without notice. Really annoying! Over all, I love spotify. Fix this problem and I'll be golden. :)"
"11419","Spotify","I'm my own DJ!!!","MamaK","October 11, 2016",5,"I have been impressed with Spotify and the choices in songs available to me!  I love creating my playlist to fit my moods and activities.  Sometimes I feel nostalgic and want to hear an all 80's line-up to listen and remember.  But other times I just want to work out to Springsteen,  Billy Joel, Elton John and too many more to list!  With Spotify I can personalize my playlists any way I want.  When you've got a must have song and you want it to appear several times throughout the playlist?  You can make that happen with Spotify!  I can even listen to my Christian music all day long and never run out of song choices.  You can even listen to playlists that have already been put together if you don't want to create your own.  Add songs or remove songs anytime to make a playlist truly your own!  Gotta love it!"

"11422","Spotify","Great App!","K. Selby","December 25, 2014",4,"Love this app. Much better than Pandora in my opinion, because you can make your own playlist, with your favorite songs. Only fault is that you have to buy a Premium if you want to be able to play certain songs when you want. You can only shuffle otherwise. You have a limited amount of skips, but more, it seems, than Pandora. They have all the songs I want. Even the most  unknown to the people around me. Over all, a really fantastic app.Update: There was an update on my Kindle Fire HD, and now I can pick whatever songs I want to play whenever I want to play them."

"11426","Spotify","Meh..","Isaac","March 4, 2015",2,"Something is very wrong with this app, it wants to reinstall itself everytime I open it, it's very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/20th of the amount I wanted to have, offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off, I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account, so everytime I deactivated my original and opened spotify, it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can't switch payment plans to another account so it's stuck on that until I get rid of spotify, which will probably be soon."

My husband, kids and teenager, and I all have our own playlists and can listen on any device, even at the same time, on the same account. We use the 'listen offline' option all the time! No internet, no problem!  However, you can't set parental controls, which means the teenager has to be careful, otherwise the younger kids get explicit music showing up in their feed. I think if we paid $5 more we could have individual accounts for family members? Anyway, its a great app."
"11430","Spotify","Spotify App has Limitations","Tracey C. Taylor","March 3, 2015",3,"I love Spotify. I'll say that right now. I have it on my iMac, my iPad, and on my kindle, and I don't even pay for premium. I am, however, very disappointed with the kindle spotify app. I can still make playlists and listen to radio, but I have a limited number of skips and it never plays the song I want it to. It shuffles and suggests songs constantly and also plays songs over again. What I don't understand it why I have these limitations on my kindle but not on my iPad or iMac. Is Apple so superior that I can't have the same update on my kindle??"
"11431","Spotify","Worked great, Now almost unusable","Christin Hobbs","January 20, 2015",2,"At first this app worked great in my office at work for several weeks. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, it can't get through a single song without skipping or dropping the song. I tried adjusting the settings. This did not help. I also tried downloading the songs to my device. This seemed to help slightly, but songs are still skipping or failing to play. It doesn't seem to be a problem with my network as other streaming apps (I.e. Pandora) seem to be working just fine. I'm about to drop my spotlight premium subscription if this issue is not resolved"

I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all .

I get the premium update when I know I'll have more time for music and cancel it easily when I don't. I try all kinds of music because there's no risk. No one likes buying a disc they end up not wanting. Spotify has an excellent variety of music.There's no need to store things. It's great for people who don't have tons of space for CD towers. I am in my mid 50's and find that this is easy to use. It's not just for millennials."

"11443","Spotify","Spotify is cool","J.J. Jackson","September 22, 2016",4,"Spotify offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and audio books. The ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me. Listening to new albums from artists like, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years, is pretty neat. And the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music. The only problem with Spotify is some of the glitching I've experienced with Android tablets, other than that, Spotify is cool."

And that's free to and its so easy to make the a account. This app is so fun.

"11450","Spotify","Great, but...","Kurtkahoot","March 23, 2017",3,"Spotify is amazing, except for the fact that every time I open it, it says there's no internet connection, when there CLEARLY is. Because of this, I have had to (for the past two weeks) delete the app almost daily (1-2 times) and redownload it. It frustrates me how slow it is sometimes and I am contemplating on whether I should delete Spotify for good. On the other hand, I use it every time I use my tablet (it's great to use while getting ready!) I enjoy that you can make playlists, follow them, save songs, etc. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys listening to music frequently, but be aware if it says there's no internet connection. I don't know if it's just my tablet or not, to be honest. ✨"

I think if they want to recommend you songs, they should e-mail you them like the old way."

I do not have Premium, (for those of you who don't know what that is, it is the version of Spotify that you pay for.)  However even without Premium, Spotify is an all around amazing music app! I have never really had any trouble with it, and it plays all of my music like a breeze. I happen to have gotten Spotify when it wasn't really a big music app, and even then it worked great! It updates every now and then and makes it better pretty much every time. I would highly recommend this incredible app, especially to music lovers that just need a good music app. It has a lot of features including, following music artists, creating your own playlists, picking who you want to listen to, and you can also go to the ""Browse"" section and from there pick from a lot of genres and even sleeping sounds to help you sleep. There are radio stations to listen to as well. Great app! I would say the best ages that should get this app are, 11 and up. Depending. I love Spotify and if you get it,  (which you should) then you will too! Thank you for reading this I hope I helped you make a decision on whether or not to get this amazing app."

It doesn't continuously play even after hitting the loop button meaning it'll play a song and leave a 5-10 minute break in it. And the advertisements are aggressive to the point of insanity. That being said it's the only app of its kind that allows you to select your songs from all songs so I guess it's a necessary evil."

"11490","Spotify","BEST app for music","MacF","March 17, 2017",5,"I can't even express how much I love this app. I've tried iheartradio, the Windows music thing, iTunes, and this, and Spotify is the best out of all of them. I had been using the Windows music thingy (I forget what it's called lol) but I needed an app for my kindle that does the same thing-- Spotify is that app, only its better than what I was using. You don't have to download the music-- it's all there in Spotify's massive library of songs, albums, artists, and more. You can create playlists, listen to songs, save music, and much more. Only on some occasions do you ever search for a song and see its not there-- about 98% of songs you search for are there. I found out about Spotify because my friend recommended it to me and at first I was a little skeptical because you have to sign up for it, but everything (even the deluxe albums) are still FREE. My dad asked me if it was legal because everything is free and yes, Spotify is 100% legit and legal-- they get there money from 30 second ads about every 15 songs or so. The only small error I ever encountered was sometimes it takes a minute to load, but that's probably just my old kindle. This app is also compatible with every single device I've ever used. Overall, I love this app and I hope you get it because it took me a long time to type this"
"11491","Spotify","alright but.......","Someone","March 23, 2016",3,"I deleted it by mistake and downloaded it again but I could not sign back i n because I had forgotten my password.

For one, Spotify has a tendency to crash randomly for no apparent reason. Secondly, typically when I open up the app, it acts as if there's no internet conncection (Home page, browse page, search bar, and Recently Listened all fail to load), even when connected to WiFi. I can still access my playlists and saved albums (because despite what it says, it is actually connected) but whenever I try to access the kenu for a tracks it says ""No internet connection"". However, despite all of this, the app is far from unusable. Usually after the app crashes and you go back into it, it works fine, and a lot of the time stuff will eventually load as you're using the app. I just wish it was more consistently reliable."

The app restricts your ability of listening to your music when you want and what you want to play.

"11553","Spotify","I love Spotify! Spotify premium is totally worth it","Amazon Customer","July 23, 2016",3,"I love Spotify! Spotify premium is totally worth it. The only problem I am having is that the app tends to act up. I'll skip a song, and the next song will play but the first song will still be shown in the notification bar. When I click on the song to get to the app, Spotify doesnt respond and I have to close it. It's so frustrating."

They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I don't use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist (online or off) has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, & always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit ""Home"" before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it & selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you're also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!"

Not recommended if you aren't ready to spend $10/mo to go premium, which I find quite expensive, hence not an option for me at the moment. 1 star because there's no commamdable middle ground here, planned in a way to force users to go premium or stop using spotify altogether. 😔"

The only reason I became interested in Spotify was that I bought an Amazon Echo. Although I have a Prime membership with Amazon, I found a lot of music I grew up with in the 60's wasn't available through Amazon Prime, but it was through Spotify.  (Of course, for what amounts to $120 per year for Spotify, I could probably buy a boatload of music on Amazon that's not available on Prime.)  Plus, Spotify has a lot of compilations of different kinds of music I like.  From reviews I read before uploading Spotify, it seemed like they were the premier site for a broad range of digital music, and that seems to be true."

"11987","Spotify","Spotify is just what I needed to help with my music obsession","Susan Tomlinson","April 3, 2016",5,"I listen to music for hours (10+) every day from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep at night. I have a rather large and unwieldy music collection ranging from hundreds of vinyl albums to cassette mix tapes (remember those?) to CDs to untold mp3s. SPOTIFY is a place I can almost always count on to have all my music collection queued and ready to play anywhere I'm online. Then, there's all the music I've yet to discover, old and new. Even listening all the time is not enough to even scratch the surface on new releases. I am frugal, but 9.99 a month is well worth it to me. I love Spotify."

I heard some reviews complain abut the shuffle play being only play back option.  The Spotify app does make it appear the only playback option is Shuffle Play as button is prominent on top play list, but to bypass just click  on first song to start playing music and the songs will continue to play in descending order as your playlist is built.  Enjoy.  Now for the Amazon Fire HD music app - go back to school or at least try and mimic Spotify if you want to have any success."

Since this week I was forced to move to the latest version in the app store here (old version was 'not supported anymore'). Now my BlackBerry passport crashes all the time, offline mode can't be activated anymore and I need to login everytime I start up Spotify + battery drains... Ones you are addicted they take advantage of you. Make your own playlists with your own music in the device's native client and realize the control you lose when these cloudbased solutions are out of the 'yes we have another customer mode!' and leave you in the dark without access to what feels like your music collection!"

True, Spotify will play edited albums if you search for them,  but there's no telling what else will start playing in that station. I used up all of my skips and still got stuck with a song that swore a lot (that was just on an Angels & Airwaves station. They rarely swear but I was playing an edited album just to be safe). If Pandora's license allows them to give users the option to filter explicit content, surely Spotify should be able to as well."

It must have happened just today because I still had all these freedoms when I was listening to my music last night, but the most recent update is upsetting, to say the least. This once wondrous app which once gave me free access to a complete library all in the order I wanted, is now as crappy as the mobile app for phones. I really loved this app before then, it was the quickest and easiest way to listen to music how I wanted, but now I can only shuffle my playlists. NOTHING ELSE. To the creators of this app, I don't think you fully realize how absolutely frustrating it is when you want nothing more than to listen to certain songs, but because of the recent update on the app you have to pray that you can find the right song in the limited number of skips the app gives you, and when you don't, you feel an empty depression form in your chest. I know the quick and easy way to solve this would be to buy spotify premium, but guess what?? Not everyone can afford to spend $24 a month+ just for music!!!! :D SO glad to see that this app is now more concerned with getting rich than the value of sharing wonderful music with everyone! I'll definitely be looking for other apps now that offer the same wide library but free access to order the songs as you wish.This app WAS great, but overnight I'm assuming some corporate bum took over and decided to rob half the world of music. Good on you, bub. :')"

Two drawbacks is that if u have the kindle fire HD6, you won't have to web player option, that lets you choose whatever music you want just with ads. Then for the downgraded  devices, you don't have web player.I just make playlists of just one song so I can listen to whatever I want though, so it's no issue for me at all.

Now I understand that a mobile version of the website is going to necessarily be less flexible than the site.  I get that.  But why I'm limited to shuffle play, I don't understand.  Surely that's not a huge memory issue?Here's the thing, I'm a writer..  I put together playlists for each piece I work on and listen to them as I write.  I take a lot of time deciding what the right flow is on my playlists, and hearing them shuffled kind of defeats the whole process.  Yeah, I find it irritating and it's pretty much put paid to the idea of using Spotify on my phone or tablet unless I'm just going to do some random listening."

"12409","Spotify","Why did you ruin it for us??","Jack's Mom","September 9, 2015",1,"Spotify was great for tablet users. We could listen to any song and only had one ad not too often. Then they added another ad (the most annoying being for Spotify) and started playing them more often. But we put up with it because it was still free and we could still play any song. So much for that. Now we are stuck with shuffle mode. I honestly thought there was something wrong when I tried to play a song but couldn't and was dismayed to realize this was an update. Yes, I am grateful for free music and I still prefer it to Pandora because I can at least choose a playlist but this is an awful change. I have not learned to love Amazon Prime music but I guess it will have to do. Bad move, Spotify. Your service is not worth what you charge for premium and now it is not worth listening to the free service. First world problems, true, but it is a shame to ruin a perfectly good app."

If you want similar artist their name and music is to the right side of the page.  No mixing if you don't want to mix.I love being able to listen to a specific entire album(s) of an artist and that's something you can not do on Pandora... And don't get me wrong, I love Pandora."

What's the point of loading your app on my receiver if it will only work from my phone now (as of last week).

I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime (as long as I have a WiFi connection) and I'm glad the music continues to play when the screen is off (I use the app on a FireHD)I do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time (it's most likely to happen while I'm on the web) the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. (Which, btw, counts as a &#34;skip&#34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add) Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play (fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless) and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add.However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!"

You can search your favorite song and listen to it and find the almbum it was on. You can see all the music your favorite artist has and listen to all of their songs. You can like the songs and they will save them you can make your own albums and playlists. All the music is updated so they have the newest music thats still on the radio! They have a feature to this app like pandora where they can pick the music for you too!  You have LOTS MORE SKIPS than on Pandora and i heart. You can lots of stations and you can put it as background music! You can just click the song or station you want the exit out of the app and play subway surfers or do what ever you need you can turn it off and the music keeps playing! It helps save battery. You can also follow groups  and singers so you can see when they have new music out! I love spotify!  @loviemonsters!"

My college son told me about it and he just played a single album and he wasn't familiar with other features.  The radio option is great.  You choose an artist or a song and Spotify will develop a station of similar music. It's instant and doesn't need to learn your preferences like at Pandora,e.g.  My favorite genre of music (other than classical and Blues) is Celtic.  I was disappointed when I didn't see Celtic as one of the radio choices. Then I learned about the search feature and entered a Scottish band (The Tannahil Weavers) and up comes all of the Tannies'albums; All for free!

"12524","Spotify","Best app available for music lover's","Dave Dixon","August 24, 2016",5,"Absolutely one of the best apps I have downloaded. The music selection is immense. I took the free trial and plan to buy the monthly subscription. I am a big music fan. This gives me the ability to experience all genres."
"12525","Spotify","Oh, so I have to pay to listen to my own music I already own?","A. H.","September 11, 2014",1,"BEST SCAM EVER!!!!  At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service.  Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN.  Where to begin...First, disclaimer:  I'm an audiophile.  I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies.  I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake.  So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line.1.  Algorithm.  Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably.  All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock.  In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement.2. GUI.  Not horrible, but certainly not the best.  Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready.  Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!!  If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly.  Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song.3. Paying to play owned music.  This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person.  While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly?????  Can someone make sense of this to me?  Why are people paying for this, again????  Ridiculous.  Developers:  The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!!  Otherwise, why even have this feature?  Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service.  Let the people play their owned music for free.4. Equalizer.  Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED.  Look up Poweramp.5. Cost.  So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good.  Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT.  Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month???Did I mention this is a brilliant scam?HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE:  If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price).  If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify."

However, you can pick only the songs you want to hear right from the beginning.  It's not like you ""seed""the station with a song or artist, then watch it go into crazy directions.  Yes, it only shows a certain amount of skips, but if you create your own playlist with the songs you want, then it really isn't a big deal.  In addition, you do have to hear the occasional advertisement, but they are few and far between.The big difference to me is the cost of premium membership.  I believe Pandora charges about $30/year, while Spotify is $10/month.  That is a huge difference, however Spotify let's you not only listen without interruption, but you can skip to your heart's content, and listen to ALL your favorite songs.  AWESOME!Despite the advantages, I think I'll stick to the free version.  Just can't justify $120/year for music."
"12614","Spotify","Slick and Nearly Everything in Music ---Best Buy in Music","Kindle Customer","November 24, 2015",5,"I listen to A LOT of music and a lot of it is alt-country, folk, and Americana. Other than purely local bands (and even some of them are here), Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love.  It has way more than other subscription services I've tried.  The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another.  I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I'm listening to to a playlist, I won't find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device.  I also miss liner notesBut these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who don't mind commercials  Hey, someone has to pay the bills.Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it's just more convenient.  I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly  works for major commercial artists, but that's not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs?  When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."

Several attempts were necessary, possibly due to the screen size and location of data entry fields.  After installation I searched for and selected an album to listen to, but could not locate the play button; but a shuffle play button was available.  This started music but switched to a genre' format not allowing the songs from my selected album to be heard in order.  This may be fine at times for some users.  Odd that I did not see this limitation when downloaded to my WINDOWS 7 PC.  Like PANDORA, product adds will be heard after so many songs.  I have not tried the premium version of Spotify for the KINDLE FIRE / ANDROID / TABLET.  I may try downloading again to see if I missed something."

I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed.  I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop.  I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data.  There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists,  which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder.  It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about.The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you'll understand. Love, love, love Spotify!"

I liked it much better when I could listen to the songs when I wanted to. I understand with a free app I should expect ads, I don't have a problem with that, but this shuffle mode and not being able to hear a song sample makes this app terrible.

Now you can't listen to a freaking song without hitting &#34;shuffle play&#34; and after that it gives you other songs that you don't even like and it doesn't let you listen to your own songs. Now you can't skip either, and you can only listen to 1 freaking song on your playlist, then it starts playing the suggested songs which you can't skip. Seriously?!

I have a very eclectic taste in music and Spotify allows me to sample, search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment. I particularly like the ""Discover"" function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections, but does delve into areas I had not previously encountered. That route has introduced me to performers I had never heard of in the past (and my past is pretty extensive). Also Spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that I particularly like. I use only the free download so I do have to listen to short commercials now and again (and they are repetitious), but since most of my music listening is via radio, that is no biggie. I highly recommend Spotify to music listeners of any genre>"

"12657","Spotify","Almost got it.  So close.  Mostly perfect.","killermist","February 8, 2016",4,"Very ""manual transmission"" in design.  For some, this is a great thing.  You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save.  I'm ambiguous on what ""follow""-ing an artist actually means... but whatever.For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode (pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants), all this freedom can seem horrifying,  It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.No consideration is really given for what you already own.  This could be frustrating if it isn't considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track (that the service is aware of) to the person's own catalog.For a person with a PC background, trying to add things (while the well behaved android thing runs) can be confusing/annoying.  This isn't a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The ""Oh, ya.  There might be desktop users."" thing seems to be an afterthought.  This isn't a criticism of the app itself.  It can only do what it is programmed to do,  But, [desktop user manipulating user's library] seems to (unfortunately) be an afterthought at best.As to music sources, there's few things lacking as I can tell.  In particular (as of this date). Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use ""Winter Light"" (a newer album/rehash, or whatever).  I can live with that."

Instead it says SHUFFLE, meaning they mix up the songs you hear. If you go to a premium choice (which probably costs money) you can have the freedom to choose and select. These sights interrupt your listening to inject commercials and if you want to pay money they stop. Its like free....but at a cost.When cable companies first started competing with long established network stations for viewers their mantra was, ""we know you have to pay for cable, but we don't tie you down with endless commercials. Has anyone watched cable programming lately? Now you pay large sums for the cable and they inundate you with ads.Pandora is the same.....don't want to pay, we interrupt your play.

No harm was done. I was fine without premium. The ads didn't bother me too much. Then, the new update happened. Now its the exact same as the phone version. I have always hated the phone version for a reason. There is basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connects to wifi, but now I just don't want to use it. There was no harm in keeping this version the same as the computer. Profit isn't an excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you as a company are crippling artists' profit at the same time. I'd rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price is a lot more reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I'm really encouraging you to change it back because I guarantee that you've lost many users to this and you're just going to lose more. I used to recommend Spotify to people, but now my view has changed. Its just not worth it anymore, so I'll just spent my time warning people off of this half baked app. You're Welcome, Spotify"

The ability to create your own playlists, surf from one related artist or group to another (in other words, discover new music economically) by listening to the entire track, and to listen offline (Premium only (it's a coded special file, so don't think you get to keep it permanently) is truly great for the listener. However, the artists are severely underpaid. Services like this one are a slap in the face for the creative geniuses that move you emotionally. If you want to do them justice, be more than a complacent consumer and tell Spotify that you demand more support to the artists they profit from. Hold Premium hostage!

First of all, you can find almost anything on it, from music to even things like guided meditation or audio books. So it's the first place I search when I hear about a new artist or song. Or if I'm looking for an old song or an artist I used to love but lost track of over the years. And lots of people, from celebrities to critics will post special playlists you can choose from as well. I'm constantly reading articles that send you to a new playlist worth checking out. I also love being able to use downloaded playlists offline if I'm driving or flying, too.The app itself is pretty foolproof, though sometimes searching can be a little bit tricky. And you still can't alphabetize your playlists, which gets messy. . Nothing else works as well or has so much to offer yet."

I get the new radio singles, new albums, singles from weird indie bands I've never heard of, customized playlists, Sunday playlists for when I want to chill, the ability to search by song, artist, or album and I can save anything I want to find it later. For how much music I listen to (every day, constantly, non-stop), I simply cannot exist without the variety and ease Spotify provides. If you don't have a membership, get one ASAP.

I had several gigabytes of music files on my computer and in the cloud. When I found Spotify, I made the decisione to get rid of all that and save space on my hard drive.You don't actually BUY the music, so you can't burn CDs or make other copies, but you CAN have the app on all your devices, so the music goes with you wherever you want. I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system, so I can listen to what I want....and no commercials!  You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want...not 'sounds like' the music you like And the best part is that you can make your playlists available offline, so you don't have to have an Internet connection to listen to your music.Another nifty feature of Spotify is the ability to view the lyrics of what you're listening to if you want. All the information about the artist is also available if you want to know more about the artists you're listening to.And for those people who are devoted to social media, Spotify also allows you to connect with friends and see what they are listening to and you can make your playlists public as well. I don't use those features, but they are available.This is the app I use more than any other on my devices. I just love it."

"12694","Spotify","I like Spotify a lot...","Dwayne","November 18, 2016",4,"Spotify became my ""GO TO"" app for streaming music.  I like the variety and flexibility. I like Spotify best when it works with my devices.  It does NOT work on my Kindle Fire.  I have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues.  They do have a tab that says FEEDBACK but it is a goat rope.  The app works great on my Samsung devices but it does not work on Amazon devices. Go figure."
"12695","Spotify","yass.","Matthew D Williamson","June 2, 2016",5,"I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times. And I feel like with Spotify, you can go on any device, log in and listen to all your favorite Playlists and Albums and Singers. And I swear I'm not trying to sound like a commercial or anything, I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music, and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So, what I'm trying to say is, Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music, new or old, at all times. And, yes, it has commercials, but only one every 30 minutes and, apparently, with Spotify Premium, you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99¢!!! I love Spotify."

Thank you Spotify. You're the best. Keep up the good work!Spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues. I have been using Spotify Premium for over 4 years now. I recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem I was having with my premium account and I realize why someone might not like it. There are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version, but I believe the premium is worth it. If your'e a student anywhere, it's only $5 a month, and that's a lot less than a new CD. I love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car, work, my personal laptop, and even my phone. It's just great."
"12699","Spotify","Great but I'm giving it four stars....","Amazon Customer","July 26, 2016",4,"Spotify is great!

Also, the recordings for some of the songs are not good at all ( piano pieces are all I have heard so far with bad recording) but I don't know if Spotify controls that or not."

My Sister (49 y o) who lives in Charlotte, NC contacted her two sons (18 & 22 y o - my Fathers Grandsons) requesting they put together a playlist for my Dad including his favorite recording artists including but not limited too Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker, & Jethro Tull. They new this was a job to be done best by SPOTIFY.The Playlist was quickly assembled by the Grandsons, they e-mailed me (55 y o) my new created User Name & Password, I followed simple provided download directions.

"12704","Spotify","Spotify recovered my hacked account and deleted playlists","Draggon","April 11, 2017",5,"Well I have both Spotify and Pandora premiums.  Spotify to me is way better though for several reasons.One, Pandora tends to skip alot and then instead of just pausing the song a second or two till it re-connects, it jumps to the next song.  Gets rather annoying.  Spotify on the other hand will pause, and then in a couple of seconds continue on with the same song.Two, I can choose playlists and download them if I know I'm going to be in a place where connection isn't very good.  Pandora is good for suggesting songs based on your likes.  I often use Pandora for that reason alone.  But when it finds songs for me that I like, I add those songs to my Spotify playlists.Third, and for the kicker.  I haven't used Pandora customer service so I can't judge them.  But Spotify customer service is Aces.  I was looking for a phone number to call them - which they don't have I found out, but that's okay.  I used their contact form on their website and they contacted me back the very next day.  The problem I was having was that my account got hacked and PW changed.  Wouldn't have worried about it too much but I had my payment info, and of course playlists that I had taken lots of time to build.  They immediately locked my account to where no one could access it, and deleted any personal & payment info.  Then restored access to me.  Not only that, they recovered all my playlists that had been deleted by this jackass whoever he/she/it may be (psyilucas@gmail.com).Anyway, several emails back n' forth with a badass rep named Christian over at Spotify, and I'm back to fully operational status!"

Its free and has ads but the ads dont bother me one ad after every few songs no big deal. Now it also lets you listen to one ad and have 30 minutes of uninterupted listening. I add my fave songs to playlists, organize playlists, and save entire albums. I just put my favorite playlist on shuffle and jam while im getting ready for work. It works great on my kindle fire.  Excellent app."

I do wish that there was info on each CD or artist, or the lyrics, the way that Pandora does."

What is great so far is that the user can choose the music they want to hear!  Unlike other music apps. What I am not sure of yet is can I as a mom of a pre-teen set parental controls that only I will be able to remove. There are some racy lyrics out there that I don't want my children exposed to just yet... including language or suggestive themes.so an update is in the future. As of this writing only I have used it and at that not long enough to vet it.."
"12712","Spotify","Awesome service if you don't mind the subscription fee. Music choice is pretty great","Connor M.","August 22, 2017",4,"Comparing Spotify to what I consider its main competitor, Apple Music, there's really no clear winner. Both services have comparably sized music libraries, and each one has plenty of content that you won't find on the other. They're about the same price and have similar features such as radio stations (although Apple Music has stations with DJs if that's something you care about), hi-fi streaming, commercial free streaming, and so on. Apple Music's library appeals more to me personally, but the client absolutely does not.The iTunes desktop client for Windows is nothing short of horrific, and they're pretty much equally inconvenient to use on Linux. I've found that they work about equally as well on OS X. You can login to Spotify on as many devices as you'd like, where Apple Music can only be authorized on six devices at once. You can't stream from multiple devices at once with either service. The Android clients for both services are great, although buffering time occasionally seems a bit longer than necessary on Apple Music. Obscure music is equally sparse on both services, but different bands are available for streaming on each of them, so it's worth looking into what they offer. I ultimately switched from Spotify to Apple Music because of that."

I created an account through PlayStation for free and used it a few times but didn't realize the extent of its capabilities.  I recently got myself a kindle fire, and have been using Spotify on it more than any other app!  Not only can you stream any song you can think of for free, you can also create and listen to custom playlists, stations (similar to Pandora), and even listen to podcasts and videos!  I use Spotify so much, and I would have to say its better than any other music app I've used by far.  If you don't mind the 30 second ad every 30 minutes, you can pay $10 a month for premium and also get lots of other features.  I would highly reccomend this app to anyone who loves music and wants it anywhere, anytime.  This app absolutely justifies 5 stars!"

"12720","Spotify","Loved it from the moment it first came out!","Charlie R.","July 10, 2016",5,"I probably should've known that is was too good to be true.  For those of you who joined spotify early enough you may recall how similar in appearance the desktop app was when compared to itunes, so similar in fact, that you could easily have mistaken it for itunes, except all the music was free!  Free has a cost though and 10$ a month for premium unlimited (when the equivalent will only buy you 10 songs from itunes, which btw has a limited number of downloads before you have to REBUY IT AGAIN) out weighs the competition pretty heavily.Perhaps in a wise move, the Spotify management did away with the Apple itunes-esque design, and replaced it with pretty much the current design that we have today.  Unfortunately, the new design took a few steps backwards from its original functionality, certain key features seem to be missing or lacking, and I personally found the old design to be more aesthetically pleasing if not simply easier to navigate.Pros:-Free with ads, or 10$ monthly membership which is 1000% worth it!-Remarkably large volume of artists and music selection to satisfy the pickiest audiophiles.-Local syncing allows you to easily add any music from your personal collection on your PC onto your phone via wifi almost seamlessly.Cons:-Programming team behind the app grows progressively ""dummer"" with each update, by which I mean they have a tendency for gutting out small quality-of-life features (like controlling title size in the desktop app).-Local syncing may require some ""massaging"" to get working at times, if you're not particularly tech savvy this can be a real dilemma.-Will eat through your phones internal storage in no time, however my provider (Virgin Mobile) offers unlimited music streaming and I get good enough coverage to never worry about buffering.Conclusion:I'm very impressed with the quality of service I get from my 10$/mo premium and can't imagine living without it (throwback to the Limewire days anyone?).  Some of the prior updates smoothed out the layout, but at the cost of functionality in some minor areas, but not enough for me to knock down a star.  Having the ability to quickly and easily sync local mp3s to my phone without the same inclusive barriers that I've come to expect from Apple products feels like a God send!  5 out of 5, I highly recommend it!"

Not having premium is not bad at all--I can still listen to all the music spotify provides, if I have wifi. And there's even a bonus, maybe only for my specific kindle: even though I don't have premium, i'm still allowed to select songs I want to play when I want to play them, instead of just playing shuffle and having no control over what's playing all the time.Occasionally, ads come a few seconds before the song is over, which is a little disrupting, but it's not really a problem.Good work, Spotify, keep it up. :)"

Previously I was unable to log-in and after repeated requests to reset my password, with the links never working, it seems there may have been some compatibility issue with my old phone.  I've been doing a lot of song/artist searches and this is a bit annoying since I can't immediately tell if a song is legit or a cover till I download it.  So a lot of deleting is going on.  I'm also finding that the search engine is poorly designed since I can input a name or title and I may or may not find what I'm looking for.  Very inconsistent.  But, that being said, I still give this 4 stars since it's a great way to find new and old music and add to my library."

It is indeed spotty as far as internet connectivity (to their app alone; I could still reach the internet and other apps), and I spend half of my time on the app, waiting for it to load again.  But I can create playlists, which is a step up from many sites; not just ""I like this band, play me their channel and similar songs/artists"", but outright putting songs in order on a listing, with the capability to shuffle.As per usual with free radio sites, I couldn't find a few of the songs or artists I wanted, and annoyingly some songs only came as excerpts, like ""Lady of Shallot"", which has 5 versions on this site, none of which include the full song."

There's a tiny but. (haha) On most mobile devices, you can only listen to the music on shuffle, which is great when you don't know which song to choose or you just want to listen to it all, but it's not when there's one in particular that you want to hear. Other than that, amazing music app. So thankful I got it, it's helped me find some new amazing music that has become my favorite 😊"

You can add any song you want to by saving the artist, album, or individual track. The music library is seemingly endless. I have found music from everywhere including the Philippines to Germany. I use the free version, which means I am limited to online use and using shuffle when I play playlists or artists. I will encounter ads every 30 minutes, after which I will have 30 minutes of ad-free music.

"12746","Spotify","Best Music App with Minor Issues","A. Cowher","September 7, 2015",4,"This is a really great Spotify app for Kindle Fire that is even better than the web app in my opinion.  You can easily access all of your options, and it plays clearly with very few issues.  One of the issues is that if you have to pause your song for a little while, you often times come back to the app saying you are not connected online.  I always check and am always connected. Clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track.  Also sometimes when playing for a long period of time, you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffering and will not play.  I tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song.  Other than that, I really like the app, and I find it to be the best out of all of the music apps (Pandora, IHeartRadio, etc.) out there."

When you get to listen to your own personal selection of music, you don't have to worry about turning the channel, or hoping the next song is better.

Like many of us, I had spent a lot of money on everything from albums, 8 track, cassetts and CD over the years. At some point that investment switched from buying to storing music. The cost of holding on to the past prevented me from experience the present. And takes me back to the beginning of my story. So my solution to keeping life's background revelation in a cost effective manner is SPOTIFY. And Spotify Connect allows me to stream Spotify thought out the home"

So yeah may not give a wake up call or drift me off into a good slumber but would not choose it over any other....."

I have never searched for an artist or song and not found it in Spotify. It really is the coolest site.The App is great too, very easy to use, and I even discover new music here.Try it, I can't think of an problems or even disappointments, and  have been a happy fan, especially in the lastt few years. IF you tried Spotify when it first was popping up on Facebook, and found it confusing (i did, but can't remember why, it has been been a while),  I encourage you to give it another go. Everything is organized and user friendly, you can follow friends &learn about new - or just new to you- songs.My 78 year old Dad LOVES this App (he has a vinyl collection to die for,  early Rock from the people who truly were the pioneers. And Spotify has it, they have the 1970s stuff my Mom digs and new discoveries she hears in radio.I only wish my music LOVING Grandmothers were around still, they both loved music so much.So yep, 5 stars from me, and my adventures into more than 80s music :( Which they also do have. 😀 the best ""Time Machine"") Sorry to gush, but I'm really happy to write about something positive!  Download and HAVE FUN!! :0)"

I stopped the subscription because it was too expensive for the amount of time I actually used it, and now that I am back to the free version, I cannot play any songs I want when I use it on my phone app. It's always on shuffle, basically no control over my music and the ads are so annoying. I got the same skin disease ad all day over and over while sitting at my work computer - SO EMBARASSING. I downloaded VIBBIDI (free) and it is WAY better, I can actually choose the songs I want to listen to."
"12757","Spotify","Best music app for streaming, discovery, and sharing","Kim","July 10, 2014",5,"Spotify is my favorite music app by far. It's great for playing almost anything you can think of. You can search by song, album, or artist. You can also search playlists that other users have created, or make your own.  The discovery features are pretty ample. Spotify makes it's own suggestions, and there are several add-ons (last.fm, Hype Machine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone Recommends, etc.) that also give great suggestions based on your listening habits or what's new and popular.  The social element is also fun. You can follow other users (including artists) and see what they're listening to, and share songs and playlists.  I pay for Spotify premium because I like having offline access and no ads!"

"12760","Spotify","spotify new user","Doughboy","December 28, 2014",5,"Well for the longest I would use this app in the free version. On PC its the best program for me even in free version because you create unlimited playlists and skip as many times as you want only there was commercials. I recently upgraded to premium and it's 100x better. No more commercials and some features I don't use. I forgot to mention spotify on mobile only allows several skips a day. With premium it acts just like on the pc. No commercials unlimited skips and you can also pick a song from your playlist and will play any song you choose. I personally liked the free version over Pandora for the simple fact that I could make a playlist on Spotify and play it on my phone but would be on random or &#34;shuffle&#34;. And now I just like the fact that I can now fully listen to my music and not be annoyed with  commercials or no more skips allowed."

When i'm putting songs into categories or playlists, sometimes it switches to the Playlist i'm working on  - if i stay on it a second too long.  THEN when i go back to the Song List - it jumps up to the top of it (to the A's) and i have to find where i was before.  This happens a LOT and it's VERY annoying.I have found many 'songs' on Spotify that i have been looking for for a long time - so that is Great!!  The Classical lists are very good as i have found Augustin Hadelich whom i absolutely love.  It has music from the early 1900's - the 20's, 30's, 40's.  i have found most of the music i really love - BUT i can't find any good stuff of Bob Seger's or  solo by Eric Burdon which he has done lately.  i am frustrated over that.Spotify sound is fantastic even on my Macbook and iPhone regular speakers.I am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed - and i still love iTunes (i'm sentimental :)"

Now I wish to get another month, but I don't have a credit card and was trying to see if I didn't have to go to the store for a card again. Five stars if it would allow me to pay through Amazon.The free trial is alright. You can get a bunch of music and create playlists. An ad comes up about every half hour. Not too shabby."
"12770","Spotify","Incredibly Useful!","Taylor","October 19, 2017",5,"With Spotify, I've been able to customize my listening more than I ever could with Pandora- Creating playlists, listening to your favorite album of that one artist you love, so much more! It aswell has similar channels in some parts to what you would find on Pandora, so trust me when I say you won't be missing much of anything!"
"12771","Spotify","Secret Overcharges - Horrible Customer Service","Boxer007","August 11, 2017",1,"First of all, I've been a loyal premium user (student subscription) for the last two years. I thoroughly enjoyed the desktop and mobile versions, as well the other features provided - offline streaming, Discover station etc.However, beware of Spotify's horrible customer service and other difficulties when using internationally. First, I noticed that I was being charged a full price subscription ($9.99) for several months despite still being a student. The automated email response by Spotify's customer service stated that the student subscription is only valid for 12 months/academic year, and must afterwards be manually renewed. There was NO prior warning for this and I was charged $30 more, without the possibility of a refund - DESPITE still being a student. I even suggested that the extra charges be put towards future subscription payments and they refused.Second, good luck using Spotify conveniently abroad. If you wish to change your method of payment while abroad, your credit card MUST match the country you are in - which is incredibly inconvenient for most users and those who frequently travel. Spotify does not offer advance-payments (i.e. 3 months or more) so this problem is difficult to avoid. Customer service is horrendously slow (24+ hours to receive an automated email response) and in most cases my question was not even addressed properly."

"12777","Spotify","The best choice for music streaming","Kenneth L Muller","November 9, 2016",5,"There are many apps that allow users “free” access to music but it usually comes at the price of extensive advertisement interruptions or limited streaming capabilities. The Spotify app combines inexpensive buy-in with user-friendly layout to make it worth spending a few dollars a month on a music streaming app.In terms of a free app, the Spotify app limits users in that they cannot stream music without Wi-Fi. Once the user decides to pay for the Premium version of the application, these restrictions no longer apply and the app becomes the perfect suite for music discovery and library curating. For this review, I will be assessing Premium Spotify and not the free version of the app.The cost for students is very affordable with a discount bringing the original price of $9.99 down to $5.99. Although for some this may seem pricey, access to unlimited music means one only needs to add 5 songs a month to reach the price per song threshold that surpasses the value of the iTunes store which charges $1.29 per song. Many will add more than this amount in new music a month and will find that it is much more affordable than other means of purchasing music and is available without Wi-Fi and without using one’s data plan if saved to a specific playlist.This is more efficient, affordable, and legal than the means available for music streaming in the past. Free applications such as Limewire or its predecessor Frostwire were based on a system of file sharing that was shaky in its legality and often led to viruses being downloaded onto one’s computer. Many of the songs were incompatible file types for iTunes which made it difficult to access music on cell phones or media players. Spotify makes it easy to access your music library by allowing integration with iTunes libraries and having cross-platform apps that can be installed on a variety of devices.Spotify has over 30 million songs in its catalog and adds around 20,000 songs each day. One still may not be able to find songs that may be readily available on applications like Soundcloud. In comparison to apps like Pandora Spotify also falls short because often times the music it chooses to match songs of your choice are either by the same artist, or are characteristically exactly the same as the selected song and offer no variety. Looking for new music often falls upon the user to search and sort through the vast catalog of music on their own.All in all, Spotify remains my top choice for music streaming based purely on its low price and extensive catalog. Supplementing Spotify with free apps like Soundcloud and Pandora work well to complement Spotify in the areas where it falls a little short. Even with its shortcomings, the price, music catalog, user friendly layout, and compatibility with multiple devices make it the best choice for music streaming."
"12778","Spotify","Caters to musical taste","Mayra","October 10, 2017",5,"Music streaming websites offer the basic functions for easily accessing music, and out of  all of them, Spotify is one of the top competitors. The company goes above and beyond to cater to their clients’ musical needs by providing a wide selection of music, creating personalized playlists and notifying them of recent activities for their favorite artists. These advantages not only allow a user to discover new music based on their personal taste but also gives a quick shortcut to make it convenient for them. With the regular updates on artists recent activities users are able to listen to their newest tracks as soon as they are released or even have the opportunity to attend their latest show. As far as the search goes for the best compatibility between a music streaming service and music lovers, Spotify is a great service to try out, especially since they do offer free trials."

Usually, on Pandora our iHeart radio, you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice. After using this app, I have found absolutely every song I've looked for but one.

I still need to figure out how the folder system works and though I have the free version on my tablet the interruptions from ads are minimal.

"12811","Spotify","I'll stick with Rhapsody.","Islander","October 28, 2017",2,"I prefer Rhapsody, where the available songs are pretty much the same, but the menus are much better organized and the privacy options seem more private, where Spotify seems designed to encourage you to make your online music experience more public.  Although you can use Spotify for free if you don't mind the ads, while Rhapsody doesn't offer a free version beyond an initial trial period."
"12812","Spotify","I'd give it 5 easily please read description.","Philicia","November 17, 2016",3,"I love this app and I'd give it 5 easily. Except for the last 6 hours or so I've been unable to use it. Claims its experiencing problems. Ive even uninstalled and reinstalled it. Started when my WiFi cut out.  I don't know what to do but I hope it clears up soon. I'm on a fire tablet and I'm NOT the most tech savy. Is anyone else experiencing this? I love that it creates radio stations based on your tastes. I love making playlists of what I like. And the service is free on my cell phone companies data plan. So all in all this app is awesome. Ive enjoyed its use faithfully for a long while. I only wished it had a alarm or a sleep thing on it. That'd be my only suggestion."
"12813","Spotify","Best music streaming service","B. Healy","September 4, 2016",5,"Best streaming service yet.  Like that I can play full albums from bands.  Pandora isn't even in the same category... I like to chose what I'm listening to, and sometimes even want to hear a specific song... imagine that.  Spotify does that, and also has a huge number of 'radio' and playlists available if you don't feel like choosing everything."
"12814","Spotify","AWESOME MUSIC APP!!!!!!!!","Clint Landry","November 29, 2016",5,"I really like this app and at the moment I am looking at christmas playlists and it is awesome I found some really good ones you should also go on and get several playlists before you start listening bc when I first got it I was listening to the same music over and over again and forgot that I can look for other music! REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"

"12818","Spotify","Likes and dislikes don't ever save or change anything","natalie","October 29, 2015",3,"I'm actually really annoyed that I keep having to thumbs down the same exact songs every couple of days. It only saves about 5 songs that I've thumbs-up or down.  I'm so over hearing Adel.It's also a major bummer that it saves the thumbs down when it's an accident, and there's no way to correct it.The screen when listening to a station on the computer is odd. Way too busy.  I'd rather it looked like it does when I'm on my phone; simple with the album artwork, artist and song title and time elapsed on song."
"12819","Spotify","AWSOME!🎆","Gregory D.","May 31, 2017",5,"Spotify let's me go quickly to all my favorite songs and artists. You can create playlists that you can easily get to.

"12822","Spotify","I love Spotify!!!!","Kindle Customer","August 7, 2016",5,"I love Spotify Music. You can pick the tunes you like, unlike Pandora.

I was constantly buying songs that I regretted within a few days of listening. But with Spotify, there's plenty of music to choose from and content for everyone. And I loved it so much without premium, but premium is even better. Not only can you skip songs, but you have a bunch of good music available at your fingertips. Get this app, I'd recommend it to anyone, because it suits everyone."
"12825","Spotify","Streams smoothly and offers a great selection of bands","Ben A","July 12, 2016",4,"Works well!  Offers offline capabilities.

"12826","Spotify","Needs updated!","Mark Grago","September 1, 2017",2,"It's quite slow until it 'warms up'! They really need to perform an update on this! It takes a while for your songs, playlists and albums to download and are ready to be played. Amazon apps are not up to MAJOR tasks!"
"12827","Spotify","YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!","James J. Farrell IV","November 30, 2015",5,"The very best music appI've ever used! Remember when you listened to exactly what you wanted? I love searching for the perfect song, or that album I haven't heard since I was a teenager. Then there are the times I just select one of countless compilations/artist/playlist and enjoy. The only learning curve is the many search and save options.....but that is why you will love it. The free version makes me wonder who would need to pay for more. I prefer streaming to downloading!"
"12828","Spotify","AWESOME!","A. Robinson","April 6, 2015",5,"Spotify has revolutionized the exposure to music in my life. I have virtually unlimited access to the music of this world here, can make my own mixes and listen to it on ALL my devices. Perhaps my favorite feature is the recommendations based on what I typically listen to. I have found several artists that I adore and probably would have never known about had not it been for Spotify. Thank you thank you thank you!"
"12829","Spotify","Love it so far","Stasey Tackett","November 23, 2014",4,"After using this app for a year or so and loving it on my walks and work-outs, I finally caved in and went add-free. I am impressed! As we speak I am listening to Coffee Table Jazz -- which is one of the many Jazz and Blues stations. Anything you want you can find, whatever suits the mood. I'm sure I'm not using it to its fullest yet, so this gives me a whole new world of music to explore. Love it so far. (I haven't tried using it offline yet, but this was one of the main reasons I went Premium.)"
"12830","Spotify","So far I love it better than any other music app I have ...","Michael David Carroll","August 13, 2017",5,"So far I love it better than any other music app I have downloaded more freedom to pick the bands I love using the free app right now probably worn upgrade still a great app highly recommend"
"12831","Spotify","Give it time and you will love it","Give it a few days","August 16, 2015",5,"Why is spotify better then all of the other music apps? Keep in mind just like every other music app if you want unlimited anything you have to pay a price. Spotify is 99 cents for the first 3 months and then 99 cents for each additional month(cheapest out of them all)●offline listing●make your own play lists●unlimited skips●share play lists with friends●good suggestions but not alot (it's not annoying● if the Playlist says g-eazy they are actually going to play g-eazy. Not iggy isalias.●Multiple playlists●with premium you can look up a whole library of music by search word (ex: country hits or Katy perry) and you can look through a already made Playlist or albums upon albums of music and you can play whatever you choose.Personally I was a Pandora person but a friend forced me to use it for a week and once you build up your Playlist with the music you like you will forget about Pandora or whatever you currently use. Also spotify graciously gives you a week free of premium use which will help you build your Playlist (although if you want to add a song to your Playlist you can just look it up spacificallly and hit the 3 dots on the right and hit the plus)So my overall advice for this app is try it out for a few days do the free trial and enjoy. You don't need premium to enjoy this app. Ads are reasonable not annoying"
"12832","Spotify","ALMOST perfect, BUT!","Dewey R. Myers","June 29, 2015",3,"Very comprehensive app for listening to most all of your favorite artists. The 'free' version works well, with commercials at decent intervals. Sound quality is very good on my Kindle Fire HD, Not the same for PC. Music rarely plays without hesitation and pauses. The premium version has a real plus, off-line listening. That is albums can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and enjoyed without WI-FI or airtime. I understand that music downloads are not transferable to a PC library or other memory. If the $9.99/ mo. premium service is cancelled, so are the downloads. As much as I like Spotfy, it has a real drawback in that the music sampled or listened to stays in a history that loads every time you activate. There is no way to delete music that you don't want to keep. That is annoying and will quickly consume memory on a phone or tablet. So close to perfect, but NOT."
"12833","Spotify","Superior app","Bridget Phoenix","January 8, 2016",5,"This app has changed how I use my Kindle Fire. I basically only download apps that are free and broadly used, and Spotify is simply the best of the best. Spotify lets you try a week of their premium version free without asking nosy and annoying questions. Use the app to discover new and old music, it is so much fun. Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive, the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate  I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle. Highly recommended, this will probably be your most used app - yes, even the free version. I am so glad they made a version for Kindle Fire."
"12834","Spotify","Best app for music playing especially with student discount.","The Reviewer Pro","June 8, 2016",5,"Don't waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does, apple music and more. Plus the interface looks cool. If you are a student, make sure you look for the student discount which was 50% of for me."
"12835","Spotify","I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon ...","Steven Rossellini & Daughters","April 20, 2016",5,"I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon for my music. I think Spotify's algorithm will suit more people who may have slower speed internet access. Spotify also appears to use an automatic gain control, limiter, and compressor in its audio chain. The ""loudness"" is consistent. That is not the case with Pandora as volume levels tend to go and down."
"12836","Spotify","The Best Music Player!","Krystal","April 21, 2016",5,"Love Spotify more than any other music player thing out there. It's also way less expensive than other players and I can listen to pretty much anything I want, anytime I want. I love that and I don't have to listen to it in a station or anything like that. I can make my own playlists, which I love even more. I just can't say enough good things about this player. I love it so much!"
"12837","Spotify","Great for Music Lovers (Better For Those Subscribed to Spotify Premium!)","Alexander Tsui","November 30, 2014",4,"Alongside with the Spotify Premium service ($10/mo.), this app compliments to the smart music lover who subscribes to the Spotify Premium service who loves to take his/her music on the go with synchronisation features for offline play for playlists. I listen to music using Spotify over other music players on my device and my playlists customised with a lot of songs on it have been downloaded so that I can just bring my phone and go listen in my car or just while I'm out there.Great for the music listener and best for those who are also subscribed to Spotify Premium!"

"12846","Spotify","Great for music however there are some problems with it.","Looser97457","January 27, 2016",5,"Overall it is an amazing program. I would say that it is the best of its kind.  The most annoying part of it for me is that I think that they play more advertisements than necessary. I know the advertisements are in part to support all of us who listen for free, but it still seems like they play more than they need too.  Usually I use it on my kindle and this brings me to my biggest problem with it. If you have the program open in the background while reading sometimes the music will just stop after the advertisement plays.  Then use have to open Spotify back up and restart the player this can be incredibly annoying.  Sometimes i will have to do it every 10 minutes.  Now that i gave the bad I will let you in on the good.  Spotify has an incredible library of music to listen to and it spans across all genres.  To go even further though they have full discography's of all sorts of Indie/Underground bands that you may have never heard of.  Spotify is a great program and I truly believe that any music fan would love it so give it a try.  Now i know that this review may seem negative, but I just want to add its only program I will use for music like this.  I wanted to give it 4 in a half stars but since i couldn't I gave it 5 because it is way closer to 5 stars than 4. Please give it a try!"

"12849","Spotify","Good concept, continued weak execution","Dread","August 12, 2017",2,"Spotty continues to have weak assed limits on downloads and songs you can save. Downloads continue to randomly disappear, forcing people to have to download again and again (a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks). Also, they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres (e.g., Reggae). It has other functionality issues, too. All of them seem eminently fixable, yet they're never fixed."

Everthing went through on the website. Spotify then decided that my daughter was not eligible for the deal just because I paid with the same credit card as my own Spotify Premium account. And without telling me, Spotify charges my daughter the full price of AUD11.99 per month for 3 months. I contacted Spotify and they will only offer one month's refund as a ""one-off courtesy"". So, Spotify charged me without my authorisation; would only offer a part refund and make it sounds like they doing me a big favour.

"12879","Spotify","Music you actually want to hear! Great App!","Maria a.","January 26, 2015",5,"I love hearing music, whether I'm relaxing at home or working out,The problem with other music apps:1. You can't really choose the songs you want to listen to2. Even if you chose a specific station the music is way off3. Once you start liking songs, you only hear the same ones every time (Pandora mainly)With Spotify!1. You can look up songs: can find entire albums to listen2. Make your OWN Playlist that will shuffle3. Less advertising (up to 30 minutes of no ads)!4. Customizable but with variety- no more same old songs playing on repeat.If that's not great already their premium is a but pricy $10/month but completely worth it!(You can try their free trial and see what works for you!)Love this app I have no idea why I didn't find it sooner!  Plus you can download the app for free now on tablets and smart phones (not sure if it's always been that way though lol)"

Every time I try to listen to music without WiFi on my playlist it says ""you have discovered a premium activity"" or something like that but ya.I think I just have to update it so that's what I'm doing now.

This app is really recommend and you should try it. You could also log in into two devices and connect them and it's amazing. It's ok if you don't have premium cause everything will be free but you have a limit of skipping songs and you would need internet. There are over 1 million songs and it's AWESOME"

I use it in my art classroom while students work, and I listen to it while I work in my studio.  My only complaint is ads, I just wish they were a bit more edited for content as people of all ages listen to Spotify.  I had to stop using it for a while in class because there were Trojan ads on every hour, I really didn't want parent complaints."
"12886","Spotify","Works... nicely","pzuidema","September 11, 2015",5,"What is there to say? Spotify on the Amazon Kindle Fire simply works. And it works as it should be. No problems, no hiccups. I love the way to use it as a remote when playing Spotify also on my computer or television. But most of all, it just has my music where I want it. And this app is simple to use, responsive.It should not trying to do more than that - which is what makes it a great app for me."
"12887","Spotify","more like 2. 5","Amazon Customer","November 9, 2017",3,"It doesn't deserve 3 stars, more like 2.5.  Spotify is great for free.  You get what you pay for.  There is an advertisement before the play list is executed and after the second song.  I have several playlists created but for some reason after about 4 songs Spotify inserts artists I never heard of.  Looses internet connection a lot.  Like I said, you get what you pay for."

Now, have you heard of Spotify Premium? I heard that you get higher fidelity sound, the ability to download your favorite music for on the go listening without using your phone data. You can listen to what you want when you want."

If you are from the 90s generation or earlier, you remember the significance of the cadence of songs and the intended flow of music.  I find my new bands with Pandora, and establish my favorites with Spotify.  After that,  I DOWNLOAD THE REAL ALBUM!  Music is important, so pay the artist."
"12897","Spotify","Yassss I luv it","Patty the Reviewer","May 5, 2017",5,"I love Spotify actually. Its easy to use, has cute designs and very easy to find new music. You can even create play lists which is cool. The ONLY problem I have with it is that sometimes it says ""Wait 30 min for the next ad"" and then next song I play there's and Ad. But beside that first world problem, Its great!"
"12898","Spotify","Things to Improve","Jessica","February 18, 2016",2,"Spotify can be great if on Android devices it didn't pause 10 seconds before the song was over for a few seconds and then continue to play! Also, when you listen to the ad for 30 million minutes of ad free minute I always get 2-4 adds before my 39 minutes are over!"

"12908","Spotify","Amazing music app","Adam M. Raver","October 26, 2016",5,"Spotify is my favorite music app. the monthly fee is minimal considering the massive music library you get access to. new music consistently added, list features allow you to save you favorites in a detailed way."

"12910","Spotify","The app is significantly worse than the website","Some dude","May 30, 2017",2,"The app is significantly worse than the website.  It will not let you select and play an album; it looks like it allows you to play an album on shuffle, but even that is deceptive, as it will include music that is not part of the album."
"12911","Spotify","Okay","Amazon Customer","August 10, 2017",3,"I guess it is okay for people who are looking for this type of app but it doesn't fit my needs so that why I only gave it three stars."

"12915","Spotify","Internet Connection","KellyB22","December 9, 2014",4,"The app is great, and I love how you can follow peoples, make your own playlists, have all of your songs in one place.... I love it. However, for some reason my Spotify has a glitch and it won't work for hours or even days at a time! It says I don't have internet connection, but I know I do because my internet works and any other games or apps I have that need internet access to works, even when this isn't. Also, there are other peoples in my house with Spotify, and it works well with them - except for a minor glitch such as mine. But besides that, it's a great app, and I think it is better than Pandora or I Heart Radio. Just giving my opinion. Thank you."
"12916","Spotify","Five stars!","Melania","August 18, 2015",5,"I have always loved Spotify! It's free and offers the best quality music you can hear, because it only has the album versions. And even if there's advertisements here and there I don't mind, but I honestly plan on getting premium soon so I can have music offline too. Aside from the great music, and easy to use interface, you can also make your own personal playlists to listen to anytime you want! And if making a playlist isn't your thing, you can start a radio station based on one song or artist, and Spotify will play you songs that are similar or related. All in all it is the best free app out there for music. I highly recommend Spotify to anyone!"
"12917","Spotify","Excellent App to listen to your favorite tunes on!!","Gloria ","May 15, 2017",5,"I used to have Pandora and Spotify is so much better.  It's nice to be able to select a specific song to play, Pandora doesn't allow you that option.  And so far Spotify allows me to skip as many songs as I want if I don't want to hear what they suggest. Pandora only allows you to skip so many songs at a time,  then it makes you wait to skip a song after you have met your quota for songs you don't like."
"12918","Spotify","Spotify","Kindle Customer","August 8, 2017",5,"Spotify is a really good music app. If you get premium you can go advertisement-free. You can create your own playlists and make them public or private. You can even access other playlists created by the Spotify team or other users. The best part is that you czmanb access full music albums from your favorite artists for free. I 100% guarantee that this app will fulfil your needs."

I can find any song and it immediately plays; no waiting for ads! And I love creating my own playlists to fit my mood. If I'm feeling lazy, there's tons of prepared playlists to choose from. Like, those to fit my mood or one to get me pumped up to start doing the laundry.I'm sticking with Spotify and don't use any other music app."

He also has a kindle fire HD, and we played no money for his. It's a fantastic app, worth even five dollars, but it's an even better deal because it's completely FREE!!!!!!"
"12931","Spotify","Good overall. Ads too loud.","Lost Gecko","October 31, 2017",4,"Overall, I like the app.  Wide choice of music.  It plays entire tracks, with noisy ads in between occasional tracks.  The ads are louder than the muic, and not controllable.

My Spotify updated, and now I have to listen to everything on shuffle. Now, I don't have premium, so when I skip lots of songs, there are lots of ads. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it sucks. Oh, you want to listen to Girls & Boys (or any song)? Shuffle. Search for a song you need to add to your music? Shuffle! Now, aside from this minor difficulty, the app is the best thing. Great work Spotify!"

You can find different genres of music, if you are wanting to listen to rock, they (spotify) have multiple playlists of that genre, if you like Indie music they have it, pop, rap, love music, acoustics, etc. they have it all. Spotify is the app for you. Spotify also has a 7 day FREE trial. I definitely recommend this to you."

"12941","Spotify","Great for a tablet","Amazon Customer","March 13, 2017",5,"Spotify is great on tablets and computers because you can play whatever you want just for ads, but on a phone its still good but not free for everything (which is understandable.

If I could express one concern/issue, it is the fact that every time an ad comes on the volume is dramatically increased....literally to the point where it is painful.  I understand the need to have ads for the free version, and I'd be OK with a slight increase in the volume, but what I experience for a volume increase with each ad is far beyond what is required or what reasonable customers should be asked to tolerate.  Any chance you can throttle it back into the reasonable range?"

There isn't anything that I haven't found and some I forgot about.I had not read any reviews prior to picking them out, my aim was to listen as I drive, I see I need premium. I don't want to pay but do I really think its going to be free? Nothing ever really is but someone has to get paid for all this. For now I'll enjoy it as is."

So many choices of music, with lots of playlists for different occasions and moods, also you can generate your own playlists, you can also skip over songs without being penalized.  Spotify is the new ITunes, in my opinion.**"

What's not to love? ad free, music available offline and they have every artist I look for. So why only four stars? Spotify has to do what Pandora manages seamlessly-allow me to block explicit content. I cannot stream radio at work for fear of the f-bomb emitting from my speakers. Fix that and you will have hit the sweet spot!"
"12953","Spotify","I absolutely love this app","PersonX","June 5, 2017",5,"I. Just got a kindle and the first thing I wanted to download was  an app that I could playbmy music on.

So glad I downloaded it! Basically it's like Pandora and YouTube rolled into one. You can listen to stations, make your own stations, and my favorite part: you can search a specific song an  listen to it right then. You can also save your favorite songs to a playlist that you can listen to whenever! Another plus is that this app has NEVER crashed or malfunctioned in anyway since I've had it. Absolutely beautiful design as well, I love this app!"

I always am happy with the music it suggests and I feel that it does a lot better job of guessing what kind of music I like to listen to than Pandora and other music apps. It kinda sucks that you have to get premium which is about twenty bucks a month to turn off ads and to download music off of the app, but that's about the same price other music apps charge and with spotify you get some extra perks for your money. Great app overall."

I understood that i had student premium plan for 12 months, when it was coming close to 12 months i talked to customer service and asked to renew again. They said they did it and i got charged for 9 months without student premium. My fault for not noticing right away, and its not about the money. But the amount of attitude i got for even showing a concern that i never got an email confirmation or an email stating that i must renew. Complete lies and honestly sad that Apple music has better customer service that Spotify. That more highly of them."

I couldn't get past all the garbage that their software downloaded to my computer. And I used the software from their personal website. Then, they wanted to know if I wanted to upgrade and pay for it. This has cost me enough."

When trying to skip a song or two offline (I have premium), the song that I skipped to does not load and I have to wait to connect to WiFi before being able to listen to a different song, really confusing, because it says that I had premium. :|"

Off and on it took me three months to get it properly working on all my devices. Help is community based, which can be both a blessing and a curse. Obviously, I have mixed feelings about this app. However, it does have potential, and because of that I would give it a slight nod over its main rival, Pandora."

I don't know if it happened to anyone else but after I had it for awhile it allowed me to choose the song I want to listen to but I am very happy with this fact. Other than the things I mentioned I loved this app"

It has almost everything from your local band that has 7 people go to their shows to the big boys. And you can listen to radio (with no ads all the skips you want) to find new music. It's really turned up my music game. I love New music Tuesday s my whole office listens to it then talks about it. Great bonding at the office."

Then I told him one day how much I enjoy it and he told me &#34;oh, I don't even use Pandora anymore, Spotify is much better.&#34; So I tried it and have to agree. My ONLY issue with this free application (I haven't upgraded yet) is that any station I listen to seems to repeat several songs...but overall, I really enjoy it."

It's a great place for finding those old songs that you haven't heard in years as well as the newest music out there. You can save your playlist to your computer to play while online. If you go with Premium you can take some of your music with you and play it offline on your portable devices. It's a great music site."
"13024","Spotify","No option to play just ""radio"", no explicit content, versions of songs.  Not good for kids or tweens.","Tim","May 28, 2017",1,"Spotify still doesn't see the need to provide any ability to control content, i.e. no option in settings to choose the ""radio"" version of songs and block explicit content versions.  Not only is this an issue for users under 18, but it's an issue if folks over 18 are want a music app to provide music at a party with kids.  They have a ""family plan"" but the app is not family friendly at all.  Also, all the lyrics are available for any user, no care about age.  As a parent I will not load this on my kids devices, as an adult I will not use it on my devices."

This was a real problem with iheart, but in all fairness it's been awhile since I used that app. Pandora used to shut down all the time saying something about getting eaten by a bear. So you'd have to keep going back to the computer to let them know you were still listening."

We cancelled a free trial we set my mom up with but for whatever reason, the cancellation didn't process. We were charged several months for no usage (because we thought it was cancelled).

Spotify customizes multiple daily playlists based on the types of music you listen to. It also shows you concert tickets and newly realeased albums. My only criticism is that you want to listen to a certain song, download a song/playlist, or skip/go back then you have to pay. That's not a ridiculous asking price I'm just too cheap.  I thoroughly enjoy this app!"

I have not liked a music service this much since the real Napster.  I will say that Apple Music has several artists that spotify is missing(Taylor Swift).  However Apple Music does not currently work with android devices.  No android is a deal breaker for me.  Amazon's Prime music service is missing so many artists it is hardly worth mentioning."

There is something for everyone and it is simple and easy to use. My only complaint is that when listening on my kindle there is no back button in the drop down bar at the top.

You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!"

Nearly. The only downside to it is that you have to pay $9.99 a month if you want to listen to all your favorite tunes offline. Other than that, THIS APP IS AWESOME. The variety of music makes it hard for me to choose what to listen to next, and you can create your own playlists for free."

It has nearly every artist and song (minus Taylor swift) and the new songs are released here as well. If you go premium, you can add songs to a playlist and make it offline, which downloads the songs so you can listen to them when not connected to WiFi. Also if you're in college, you get a discount on going premium. Overall this is a great music app and definitely worth your time."

Tap into a vast amount of music with this app. We love for the Spotify platform.However:This app really needs to be revisited as tablets, phones, and non-traditional operating systems (i.e. Chromebooks and Linux) become more prevalent and users begin to use these devices as their primary access to the internet. There are features that are unavailable with this app which make playlist management cumbersome at best. It seems that if you are going to fully utilize the amazing Spotify service you need to have a Windows (or maybe Apple? - I am not an apple user) machine and a copy of the local software."

I got to choose what song I listened to, and I didn't have a limit on however many songs I could skip. Oh, but then here comes this bulls***, I can't choose what song I wanted, it suggests songs that I couldn't care less about, and now I can't even skip it because I've reached my limit, skipping the songs I don't want to listen to.I got an app that wasn't like Pandora, and it was hella nice. But now it's changed into the equivalent of that.To sum it all up,I can't choose my own musicI couldn't care less about the suggested musicI hate the song-skip limitI just wanted to listen to one song, but then I end up listening to ten because I'm unable to skip over to the song I want.I'm just disappointed, tbh."

But lately, when I get the 30 minutes of ad free music, it gives me an ad within two songs. All the time. The ads have increased tremendously and I don't know what's changed.  I know I'm using the free app, but it's ridiculous that they tell me I'm getting 30 minutes of ad free music and then they play an ad after the next song or two"

However, what's not fun is the fact that I got logged out in a different country, and can't log back in. I listen to music with this app every day, and this is a pretty big deal for me. I'm still in that country, and if you could fix this, I'd give it 5 stars."

However, with Spotify, you can look up a song and play the whole song, free of charge. They do have very little ads. There is a premium option and that allows you to "" download"" the songs so you can listen to them off of data and Wi-Fi. It also removes the ads. However you have to pay for that feature."

I like that your music continues to play when you go into other apps and even when you turn off your device.

Believe me I was surprised, spotify had music that pandora didn't have yet! Also there were way more features on the free version that Pandora 's paid version didn't even have like how you can play certain songs on genres, the radios obviously has limits but it gives me way more control."
"13472","Spotify","Great but loud ads","Kindle Customer","May 6, 2016",4,"Great variety of music, love that you can save songs and make playlists.

"13477","Spotify","Best Music App!","Amazon Customer","September 29, 2014",5,"Spotify is definitely my new favorite music app. I love how organized it all is and how you are able to create and name your own personal playlists. It is also up to date with some of the newer music, yet still has some of the older, still good music. I love the variety of bands and artists it provides and the organization offered. So if you haven't thought of it yet, Spotify is the app to get for playing music. :)"
"13478","Spotify","I give it 5stars","Sarah Stockum","December 23, 2015",5,"You can get WiFi  free trial.

"13479","Spotify","works seamlessly","Amazon Customer","February 22, 2015",5,"Syncs to all devices easily. Intuitive design makes it easy to create playlists and organize your music.  I like their radio function better than pandora, less repetition of liked songs. Only unable to find a very few artists.  Coming from the school of record digging and hunting, this makes underground music almost TOO easy to find!  A whole new school and Spotify is the best way to listen to music in the modern world."

"13483","Spotify","Pandora convert","DIANE","August 26, 2017",5,"I am a convert from Pandora.  I listen to new age music to sleep and the constant commercials got to be irritating...and I didn't want to pay extra just for sleep music.  With Spotify and my prime membership I have never had a commercial, listen to the station I like, select tracks I like and download them so I can listen offline in a cabin in the woods or anywhere I want to be lulled back to sleep.

Awesome. But it also plays &#34;recommended songs&#34; or songs from the album you got your chosen songs from!"

"13798","Spotify","Not what I thought it would be...","Sarah","June 10, 2014",2,"When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled.When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad.When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.Now, I'm just disappointed.I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch.That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:1. Without premium, one must be online to listen.Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle.Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this.Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring.Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".).You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet?Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.Spotify on my computer? 5 stars.Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora."

Unlimited skips, huge library of music, and great quality sound. But Spotify Premium is even better. Download songs and listen to them without WiFi/cell service. Only have had one problem; a glitch with the app mot letting me sign in, but was fixed. Besides that, best music app there is."

Often will say 'Track not available' for no reason, even though it is on a playlist or actually stored on the device, and I do have an internet connection anyway. Often songs will say it is playing but there is no sound. Some songs just won't play, ever, no matter what. Sometimes songs are missing from an album. Huh? The 50% of the time Spotify works the way it should I like it, but the other 50% of the time is beyond frustrating. I blame the Kindle's terrible proprietary software for the problem as much as the app itself, though.Return your Kindle asap, buy a real tablet, download the regular Android version of Spotify that will actually work."

Had it for almost a year...- could NEVER get ""My Songs"" to play correctly (using 2 different laptops and three different Android phones in that time).  Some would play, wome would just not and whenever they would come up it would stop the entire shuffle....and then they would play the next time through....- Making play lists and saving things for Offline use is a pain in the ass!!- The ""artists like this"" or ""songs like this"" function is no better than Pandora (and I've never paid for that premium service""I went to Spotify because Itunes is a pain....but honestly it's no worse...plus had I stayed there, I would actually OWN all the songs I've found on Spotify in the last year!"
"14229","Spotify","A top notch app","Jocelyne Sol Gonzalez","March 17, 2016",4,"Downloading this app was a great idea in my part. The app ( like pandora) had a variety of both music and radio stations. But this one allows the listeners to have a choice on what to pick. So if you wish to have a bit of music in your life than downlaod this app."

Unfortunately they've dumbed down the social features and the app can be glitchy. Still deserves 5 stars."
"14233","Spotify","A little better than Pandora Plus, but twice the price.","r. krueger","February 18, 2015",3,"It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over (unlike pandora) but $10 a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."

But now with the new update everything is pretty much the same except now your not able to fast forward and for certain songs all there is are covers. Which stinks because if you were able to fast forward unlimitedly I would rate this a 5 and more."
"14242","Spotify","My favorite music streaming app!","K. Stuckey","September 12, 2014",5,"I love making playlist on my PC and listening to them on my iPhone. I have lists for running, camping, driving, chilling, pretty much anything. Sure there are ads in the free version, but you have to decide for yourself if it is worth ponying up money to skip commercials and listen to music on demand. It is still way fewer breaks than FM radio and I don't mind my playlists shuffled."

MacDonald","July 19, 2017",4,"It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if it had more free use instead of most of it being premium features that have to be paid for. I'm not paying money to use an app.  Sorry ain't happening. What should have been free is the ability to make a playlist and also search for actual songs and play just single songs and that stuff isn't fee.  It's a good app but it's not the best especially for those folks who don't have spare money to waste."

"14910","Spotify","Free is terrible.","Alec","September 14, 2015",1,"The premium is nice but the free version requires you to shuffle songs, which would be fine if it played more than two songs of the album or playlist that you wanted to shuffle before playing nothing but suggested songs for a while, and with only a couple opportunities to &#34;skip&#34;. So now you rarely listen to what you want (which is the point of music streaming), certainly rarely any particular song. You will be alarmed to try listening to Hozier only to instead become bombarded with suggested songs that you skip, so that you're out of skips when &#34;All About that Bass&#34; inexplicably appears to assault you with no escape."

STUCK WITH SHUFFLE","JOE","August 26, 2015",1,"The functionality of this app is fine and I really enjoy Spotify, but how gimmicky is it to offer any song listening on tablets and desktops but exclude Fires as tablets, which was a strong point of me getting this tablet. I think this is absolutely absurd, and seems like a cash grab at Fire users, forcing us to go &#34;premium&#34; or relegate us to &#34;shuffle&#34; that free mobile users have to use. This is a big deal honestly. The Fires are tablets. Plain and simple, I should be able to choose whichever song I desire with the accompanying AD's. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT STREAMING SERVICE. SPOTIFY IS NOT HONEST IN ADVERTISEMENT."
