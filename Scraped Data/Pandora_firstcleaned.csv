"282","Pandora","pandora review ","WR450f_09","October 31, 2013",4,"pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they re getting i have been using the free version for about two years now listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2 3 songs but hey it s free so i can t dispute it otherwise the commercials are relatively short but it wouldn t hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same home depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours i have yet to purchase pandora one but the thought has crossed my mind since it s only a measly 3 per month this version eliminates all commercials pros: free offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a whilecons: commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when i first downloaded not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station you hear the same tracks if you re a daily listener rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes but the more you rate the better it fixes itselfoverall recommendation:if commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car i would definitely pay the 3 if there was a guarantee for better variety but until then i m satisfied with the free version and who knows maybe that s why i m shopping at home depot more as of late "

Nenstiel","December 29, 2012",5,"many prior reviewers have bemoaned the number of ads on pandora stations to which i reply: so? the ads are less frequent less lengthy and less disruptive than on a typical clear channel broadcast station considering the number and range of songs pandora provides and that royalties consume much more of digital radio s revenue than broadcast i don t begrudge them paying for themselves since the ads aren t loud i can handle a few interruptions i m more impressed by the fact that pandora offers a wide array of music in nearly every genre including music too edgy or dangerous for conglomerate owned media outlets especially for those of us who live in the hinterlands pandora provides an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with music we would never otherwise encounter i ve been able to broaden my exposure to indie rock international and ethnic music daring composers and innovative singer songwriters and getting it for my smartphone has been a real boost i m able to connect the provider to my car radio the stereo at work or my headphones and carry my innovative music around with me the sound is clear and translates well onto larger speakers meaning i can enjoy it on my commute or my morning exercise regimen without having to accept diminished quality getting this for my phone has been a real blessing one i intend to continue enjoying "
"15597","Pandora","not only listening pleasure but discovery and knowledge","Mike Tarrani","October 2, 2013",5,"i ll attempt to not repeat what other reviews have said because there are nuances to pandora that go beyond a convenient way to listen to the music you love the first thing i love is the way artists whose work is related to your favorites that you specify in channels are slipped in i have discovered more musicians that i would have never thought of on my own through that feature i also love that i can easily peruse a mini biography of the artist on any currently playing song as well as features of the track itself for example listening to bassist ron carter s album titled saguaro i discovered that the key features of the track for piccolo include block chords on the piano and it s in a minor key that information cues me to listen to those more carefully which is a boon for musicians another feature with which i am currently experimenting is the connect to facebook link that will not only alert friends to what i am listening to but a monthly summary of my listening habits published on my timeline that i do find useful the ads can be somewhat tiresome but when i weight that minor inconvenience against the way pandora s insertion of related music into my channel plays i can live with it with a smile i have been exposed to a much wider range of music and artists than i ever was before pandora came along and this app is the key for the record this review is of version 4 1 2 which is the latest as of the date of this review features may change obviously so take this date and version into consideration as you read this review "
