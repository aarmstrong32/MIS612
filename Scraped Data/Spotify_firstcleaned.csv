"5585","Spotify","great ehh resentment ","Rashad","December 6, 2015",4,"i must begin by saying i am your avid music junkie if one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment i d be infamous by now i began using spotify per word of mouth when i was overheard verbally destroying pandora i paid for whatever pandora markets their non free service as it was a waste of hope and money after a few skips i ran into the same skip limit as if i didn t shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips the tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot nearing the end spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what i heard i thought great and i gave it a shot great; because now i have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely no fuss or gimmicks and to me that was bliss with a wide variety of music i cannot live without daily ranging from acoustic uk pop bands to old school hip hop kings such as krs one audio two and the legendary wu tang clan to our modern day rap music to my rock band faves like afi and blink 182 to beyonce and katy perry for the softer pop music feel for the kids ears and reggae and 60 s 70 s kings and queens of soul music i can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and i love that i even have french rappers and singers songs idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention that s what made spotify so great to me i have exactly 20 playlists with over 1700 songs and i created all the playlists to my liking and all available offline for my enjoyment anywhere i can skip endlessy i can jump to another playlist whenever i feel the desire and that s how music should be enjoyed so why the ehh? ehh; with all the above praise that i will not recant in fact i can ad more to it there is a bummer to spotify unbeknownst to me the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory being that at that time i had the app installed on both my ipod and iphone i never paid attention to it but after tossing the pod i noticed with my iphone that spotify was using up 4 5 gbs of the allotted 6 3 gbs there weren t enough photos games and apps to remove to clear up space my resolve was to purchase a tablet i know that has external storage per microsd cards i ended up with the kindle fire hdx 8 8 gb and purchased the 32 gb microsd card my plan was to download spotify move it to the microsd and never have to worry about external storage and spotify clashing again to my greatest disappointment and i mean grave disappointment at this point it turned out that spotify cannot be moved to my 32 gb microsd card it was infuriating to be casual at the least ok resentment; spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is if you cannot afford premium the app is useless and that s just based off the experiences i ve read over on reviews from mobile app users if you do have premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up if i only knew spotify unlike let s say netflix cannot be moved to the microsd card from my hdx 8 i probably would ve gotten a bigger kindle what really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after amazon s preinstalled entities we consumers of the hdx 8 8 gb start off with a mere 5 3 gb so how does one cope with the ups and downs of spotify and external memory clashes? you grab your headphones scroll your favorite playlists you created skip and scroll through your music freely and be thankful why? because it could always be worse pandora in writing this review i see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes may have lead to adverse feelings towards spotify but i do have to say this it is a superb application i have it on my iphone for on the go for the home depends on where at home it can be either the xbox the smart tv and now the hdx 8 you can t really beat or put a price on that spotify however did and it s only 12 99/month what s that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? yea i ll pass and will continue to pass the word on about spotify hope you found this helpful you will enjoy spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor premium is the only way to really get a full grasp on the application and it s features if you claim to love music you need spotify premium you can t go wrong "

"9092","Spotify","people don t understand this amazing app ","Onyx","December 15, 2014",5,"this app is simply amazing it s musical heaven almost any song or artist you can think of right at your fingertips a lot of people use it similarly to pandora; they put it on a station or mix and that feature is decent the algorithms aren t great honestly it works best if you use it similarly to itunes finding the songs artists or albums you like and putting them into playlists you can have as many different playlists as you want and for people that don t want to pay for premium service you don t have to you get all the aforementioned features with the free version the premium version is far too expensive and the only benefits i m aware of are higher quality audio offline capabilities and unlimited skips but with an app so spectacular you don t need to pay 9 99 monthly for such petty benefits also people that complain about having to create an account through facebook or email they don t email you constantly or post all over your facebook you can set your facebook to disallow posts from spotify and as far as email i ve had my account for 5 months and i don t think they have ever emailed me bottom line: this is a must download for music lovers hope my review was helpful :)"

"12777","Spotify","the best choice for music streaming","Kenneth L Muller","November 9, 2016",5,"there are many apps that allow users “free” access to music but it usually comes at the price of extensive advertisement interruptions or limited streaming capabilities the spotify app combines inexpensive buy in with user friendly layout to make it worth spending a few dollars a month on a music streaming app in terms of a free app the spotify app limits users in that they cannot stream music without wi fi once the user decides to pay for the premium version of the application these restrictions no longer apply and the app becomes the perfect suite for music discovery and library curating for this review i will be assessing premium spotify and not the free version of the app the cost for students is very affordable with a discount bringing the original price of 9 99 down to 5 99 although for some this may seem pricey access to unlimited music means one only needs to add 5 songs a month to reach the price per song threshold that surpasses the value of the itunes store which charges 1 29 per song many will add more than this amount in new music a month and will find that it is much more affordable than other means of purchasing music and is available without wi fi and without using one’s data plan if saved to a specific playlist this is more efficient affordable and legal than the means available for music streaming in the past free applications such as limewire or its predecessor frostwire were based on a system of file sharing that was shaky in its legality and often led to viruses being downloaded onto one’s computer many of the songs were incompatible file types for itunes which made it difficult to access music on cell phones or media players spotify makes it easy to access your music library by allowing integration with itunes libraries and having cross platform apps that can be installed on a variety of devices spotify has over 30 million songs in its catalog and adds around 20 000 songs each day one still may not be able to find songs that may be readily available on applications like soundcloud in comparison to apps like pandora spotify also falls short because often times the music it chooses to match songs of your choice are either by the same artist or are characteristically exactly the same as the selected song and offer no variety looking for new music often falls upon the user to search and sort through the vast catalog of music on their own all in all spotify remains my top choice for music streaming based purely on its low price and extensive catalog supplementing spotify with free apps like soundcloud and pandora work well to complement spotify in the areas where it falls a little short even with its shortcomings the price music catalog user friendly layout and compatibility with multiple devices make it the best choice for music streaming "
