"1","Amazon","I like it better than Pandora.","mob","March 28, 2016",5,"love this music app.  great selection.  Better than Pandora. Use it on my Samsung Phone.  Not happy, however, that I cannot seem to get the app on my Samsung Smart TV. I get the Amazon Cloud app but not the Amazon Music App,  (Amazon, if someone could contact me about this, would greatly appreciated)  The Amazon Cloud app does not seem intergrated with the Amazon Music app.....Thanks!"
"2","Amazon","In order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it's just not worth payhing a year in advance for it.","William Davidson","June 30, 2016",3,"Lots of product but I just didn't use it enough to justify spending over a $100 dollars a year on this.  Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can't pay monthly which sucks.  Maybe if they started charging monthly I'd sign up again.  The free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought.  But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon."

"4","Amazon","Glad to be able to get the music as a Prime member","L..Gerry","April 27, 2016",4,"Love that you can download music as a Amazon Prime Member.  Just was a little confusing for me when it asked certain questions on where to store songs and also if there was a charge for the songs. That is the only reason I did 4 stars.  I am not quite as tech savy as some of the younger people, so just would have liked a little more explanation.  Love having the music though."

"6","Amazon","Not happy","Kirby","August 17, 2015",1,"In addition to the ridiculous list of things it wants access to, this app would not let me log in to my own Prime profile. It kept logging me in under my mother, even when I put my own email and password in multiple times. She doesn't have Amazon Prime or any of my music, so all the music I just saved to my library apparently is now worthless. I guess I just go back to Spotify.  At least that's a lot easier to use and lets me log in to my own profile."
"7","Amazon","Amazon does it again!","Rebecca Combs","June 17, 2015",5,"This has been a great benefit of being a prime member. Its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything. I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known, plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs. It brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues. Great product or service from amazon. AGAIN!"

I was easily able to find music that I liked and out it where I can listen to only what I want to listen to! Lots to choose from and I have barely begun to look! My only issue is that now my son is asking me non-stop for my phone so he can listen too! As long as he stays in my country world, all will be well!"
"11","Amazon","Not bad considering its free!","Saul Castillo","June 20, 2014",4,"Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscribers but I wouldn't mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed."

The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!"
"24","Amazon","Avoid this at all costs.","Paulette","December 20, 2016",1,"I gave it one star because I could not give it zero. Nothing works on this system.

But its nice that this comes with prime because I would get Prime anyways."

I download songs at home before I leave so I don't get charged data by my wireless carrier. For the price of FREE the music selection is amazing. I have music for working out, morning walks, putting my baby to bed, studying, calming anxiety attacks, and music to get me though long road trips! As long as Amazon keeps this feature we will keep purchasing Prime!"

There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1.  The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player.  But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android.  Useless app.It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog.  I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device."

I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see.  I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices.

"72","Amazon","New update is broken **UPDATE** New, new update even more broken!","Jeremy","December 16, 2013",1,"I've used this app for nearly 2 years and it's been great. I love my Amazon cloud drive and have most of my music uploaded to the cloud drive. Unfortunately, the recent update to this app is broken. If you are listening to music and then go use another app (chrome, facebook, a game, etc.) then the music will randomly stop playing at some point. So, this app is great if you are only going to listen to music and not use your device for any other apps. I'm back to using the system music player for now. My device is a Samsung Galaxy S3.**UPDATE**I tried to create a new review, which doesn't work. Still only 1 star, though, since I can't give the app negative stars.The new Amazon MP3 app is essentially unusable. You've never been able to set the download location to download music to the SD card but at least with the old Amazon MP3 app you could copy downloaded music to the SDCard. This is such a fundamentally flawed design choice that it really makes me question amazon's focus on what customer's want. However, now it's even worse with this new piece of crap app which 1) keeps defaulting to using Prime Music when you open the app (which sucks - I just want to play my music) but, 2) even worse, when you download music and copy it to the SDCard it won't see your music even if it's in the same folder. I've also found, when I did briefly use this new version of the app, that it crashed pretty regularly.I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4.Oh well. At least the Google Music app continues to just work. Can I give that app a 5-star review on Amazon? ;)"

While it generally works OK for the music it does have I was unable to find any way to just search the music that is available through prime music and not for purchase on the amazon store so almost every time I went to listen to a song it was going to charge me.If you were able to limit the search and list of songs to only those available for free I would have given it a higher score but at the moment it was a lot more frustration than listening pleasure."

Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing.  I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond.  I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre.  That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me.  Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to.  I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon."

The selection is a little scarce, but it's new, so I'm sure the selection will increase in time.  Seems that Amazon would put more effort in their prime video service (which is still very limited and lacks the selection of their competitors) instead of launching additional services.  Just seems a little backwards to me, but I won't complain about something free!!"
"106","Amazon","I know you are not listening, BUT","Amazon Customer","July 3, 2014",1,"For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment.  First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality.  This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you.  Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time.  Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want.  I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with.  Very dissapointed.  Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else.  Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy.  Good luck with your new fire products.  Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever.  You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them.  You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps."

I've even reset my phone to factory defaults. Nothing fixes this app. The fact that this problem has existed for months now shows that Amazon is not committed to maintaining this app and therefore not maintaining their music service."

"114","Amazon","Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, you know the rest.","David","August 29, 2014",1,"Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I'm not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I'm wary about, but I took the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I've listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.). If you're listening on a web browser, it's constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music (when clicking on other music that might interest you) could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast (to my knowledge). Now that I've purchased the year subscription, I'll certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back."

I own a LOT of music, and when this app was Amazon MP3, I was easily convinced that I should upload all of my digital music to Amazon, and then I could play it wfrom my phone where ever I was (as long as I had a good internet connection, of course). Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud'  music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it. A couple of days later there was an update, which did not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the features it wants, but if I cannot play the music I already own, the app is useless to me."

Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."

"157","Amazon","The Worst Amazon Product Ever","jaydro","April 13, 2016",1,"If I could give this app negative stars, I would.I have been a longtime Amazon customer (since the '90's). When the Amazon MP3 app came out, it was great. There were free daily MP3's, and I bought quite a bit of music from my phone. Then in updates it would become sluggish, but then you'd get a new (Android) phone and it would be okay. But then there was the change to Amazon Music, and the authentication scheme Amazon came up with for this would then break my login in other Amazon apps (Shopping and Kindle). It became unusable on my last phone. When I got my current phone I tried it again, and it worked for maybe a month, before it suddenly decided that my phone had been registered to someone else and I could not access my cloud library or Prime Music.Amazon Customer Support for this is pretty much non-existent--they will only talk to you on the phone, and then they'll tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstalling EVERYTHING, which is ridiculous.I recently tried the app again, and it was miraculously working for no obvious reason (though the Kindle app would then keep asking me to re-login), but with this most recent update it is now once again broken for me--it gives me a network error, so I tried reverting to my backup of the previous version, and guess what, it now says that my phone was registered to someone else and I can't access my cloud library or Prime Music.So, I give up Amazon. I've bought a ton of crap from you, and I would probably buy a lot more music from you if I could buy it on my phone and be an even happier Prime customer if I could listen to Prime Music on my phone, but this app is a total disaster and the biggest black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company. The shopping and Kindle apps work great, Music works great on my iPad (and Kindle Fire and Fire TV), so I don't know what your problem is."

Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they (Amazon) still want you to purchase music.  If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you'll like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead.  Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you're going to run into problems.  Seriously, at  $10 dollars a month ( $5 for students first time) Spotify is a far superior product."

"213","Amazon","Another bad marketing choice by Amazon dumped over the head of its Prime members as a ""bonus""!?!","sPeeDeeBee","September 7, 2014",2,"I'm a Spotify user, having used Rhapsody for years before that. I don't buy my music to listen to. Given that, let's just say that Amazon Prime's new music addition is really next to worthless. As most of us Prime members have come to realize, the number of products covered by the Prime membership increasingly smaller and is always in flux, at its best. In some cases, it's almost laughable. Now Amazon want to tell us they've added value to the membership by featuring these incidental cuts from a tiny minority of albums that one can hear for ""free."" Not to mention one needs their Amazon Music with Prime  Music app! This is largely a piece of trash. Try getting it off your device once you've installed it! Surprise, it's part and parcel of the increasingly restrictive OS of the Kindle Fire now (don't know about others). What's more, there's no way to opt out of its constantly being loaded into memory.Come on Amazon, isn't it time that you give your Prime customers some credit for choosing Prime? MUST we make _exclusive_ use of every product you offer us as members? It's becoming much more an indentured servitude than a perks membership. Even more, with every product you become more restrictive than before. Do you consider us mindless fools? Really? Gee thanks."

Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is)."

I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me.

I wish that it would recommend music as I love to discover new artists but so far I've made it work by cross referencing a certain song with what others have added in playlists containing it."

I have recommended this to everyone I know. The cost of Amazon Prime with all that I get for the dollars is the best money I spend every year. This music just makes it better. I NEVER have trouble playing the music and being able to download music and have it in the cloud so I can hear it anywhere makes this the best music source I have used."

I do not have any problems with &#34;ONLY ENGLISH&#34; programs working just fine on my &#34;RUSSIAN&#34; phone, but somehow in order to listen to Amazon MUSIC I need to change my phone's language to English... How music is related to language? Will Amazon Music program try to speak with me? Am I suspected not fluent in English if my phone is on different language settings? C'mon, Amazon, make yourself not limited to English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Chinese if you want to promote selling stuff like music - your competitor Google Music does not have such problems.  Until this will be fixed, I would stay with Google."

"319","Amazon","mediocre music service","D. J. Nunez","February 6, 2015",3,"I'll vote in the mediocre as ""ok"" because that's all it deserves.  The main drive for purchasing an Amazon Prime account was for the vast variety of books I can purchase and borrow for my Kindle.  Otherwise, the Music app is below par.  Clunky download/upload application and the service doesn't have access to thousands of old songs from certain labels.  It's good for when playing/streaming music from my PC at home and that's about it."

It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point.

"342","Amazon","Pros & Cons","goodnitesaigon","April 17, 2015",3,"I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it's not unlimited. For the annual fee, I expected to be able to stream any music I wanted. There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora, Milk, etc., but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music."

I received a great gift from you","Amazon Customer","October 8, 2013",5,"I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs.  It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs.  At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!!  I didn't see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me.  Thank you Amazon !!"

Performance though is a problem. I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use."

I was disappointed.  It allowed me to download and play one album for free.  However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.Admittedly, I didn't mess with it for long, since the moment called for music (streaming to a Bluetooth speaker) and I didn't want to take the time.  So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly.  I'm sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.If I wasn't doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly (at least for this Prime member)."

Even though it's check-marked as downloaded, it won't let me play it and it gives me that annoying ""Internet connection required"". It's happened on my Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and an LG phone. Sometimes the lyrics are not on sync as well, or the art cover gets stuck for one song and the app 'freezes' (it keeps playing music but I cannot tap anything) a bit, then displays it correctly"
"387","Amazon","Amazon , release an instant video app for Android","PT Richards","June 5, 2014",1,"I'm ticked.  Amazon refuses to release an Amazon instant video app for other Android devices.  Amazon is more than happy to take and use Android source, but refuses to support those of us that want to use a device that does more than just consume Amazon content.  There are very few choices when it comes to video streaming sites and Amazon needs to get its head straight and start listening."

Below are my major complaints.Won't shut off - if I pause the music, ope  my recent apps and click the &#34;x&#34; button to close the app 9/10 times the music player opens itself back up, i have to do this 3 or 4 times to get it to close.Downloading music - it is great that you can download the Prime music, that is an awesome feature, however, if you only want certain songs from an album and you stop the other songs from downloading, the downloadet pops up everytime you use the app. It says the downloads are paused even though i have canceled the dow loads 12 times.  I do not have unlimited data and do not want every song from the albums in question. On the topic of downloading songs, if you search for albums or songs and download them to your phone, often times it will not show them as in your library when you search again, so you can end up downloading several copies of the same song/album. There is not consistency between the music store and your local library.Glitchy - the app will often glitch when opening or closing and will not respond to commands. I have attempted two reinstalls and still no luck.Amazon really needs to get their heads together and fix this app, it has a lot of potential, but sucks the big one right now."

It is a HUGE, space-consuming app!  Let me elaborate:  I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year.  I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l.  APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc.  Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon)  Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data!  Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!!  WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!?  This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this...With APM installed, I was constantly  receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work.  That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed.  This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!!  Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled.  When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!"

I appreciated the Video's that came later included for members, but to be perfectly honest, the selection seemed limited and unexciting so I rarely use it. I noticed in passing, this new Prime Music and imagined it would also be woefully deficient so never bothered to try it. Until a friend mentioned it enthusiastically to me, so I just this week put the app on my Android. Who knew! I still haven't done a thorough testing after just a few days, but have been extremely impressed by the artists represented. Considering the price of pay music services, this alone covers the cost of Prime. Now, I would keep Prime and did have it long before any of the added offerings were tacked on due to the volume of things I order every year. But if your hesitating, or think this Music service might be a bare bones lame offering, do not hesitate. Loving it! What a nice added bonus to a service I already loved!

I was really excited when I learned that my Prime subscription included the music service. I was even more excited to use the new Amazon Prime Stations feature. I thought it would be great to no longer use Pandora's ad-laden app. Well, beyond the intrusive nature that Amazon apps have evolved into (seriously, Bezos, what's up with the lack of privacy?) that some others have commented on, the music app needs some help in its basic functionality. It's cumbersome to navigate the search feature (you have to be in just the right sub-area of the app to find what you're looking for). The stations would be great if there were a way at all to search or organize them. As it is now, there are so many stations (100's) and as far as I'm able to tell, they are not really organized in any way, rendering them much less useful. I'm not sure why there isn't a way to search the stations or at least save your favorite ones.Come on, Amazon! Step up your game with your app design!"

A JUAN GABRIEL station with ONE album from the singer and mixed with other genres having NOTHING to do with it. Additionally, songs such as ""Amor Eterno"" listing Juan Gabriel as the singer yet when I play it, it is not Juan Gabriel singing, and there are numerous amounts of songs like that. .An OLDIES station that plays a bunch of basically UNKNOWN songs. When building a play list, we are allowed to add duplicate songs without a warning. Same applies when suggested songs are listed with an option to ""ADD"" to my music when in fact the song is already in my music. I thought Prime Music would be replacing my Pandora, not any time soon. There is not enough room here to list all the issues and suggestions for improvement..."

Audio quality is excellent, (something one of the other major streaming services does not really care about.)Why is it just okay?  Because it is not superior when it comes to playlists.  The playlists are okay, but short compared to other services.  Not something you can just pick and forget for hours of listening.  Also the choices of genres need to be expanded."

"512","Amazon","Very good product","Peter","December 23, 2013",5,"Easier than i-tunes or notoriously confusing Winamp or MS medial player libraries.  However, the quality of cataloging the songs or albums solely depends on quality of mp3 ID tags.  Sometimes, the songs from the compilation albums may be split over several albums, and that's only because the ID tags associate the file with particular album.  If you are to load your own library of albums anything can happen.  However, the Mp3s downloaded from Amazon, whether the albums or compilations,  require no action in fixing ID tags."

First, because it seems I can no longer download MY music to the SD card on my phone. If I want to download music, it has to be directly to the phone. In the FAQ's in the app, it says that this option is available only on some phones that run Lollipop and KitKat. I just got a new phone that's running Marshmallow, so the option to download music to the SD card is grayed out. I don't choose to clog my phone up with music downloads, or alternatively use up my data streaming it. What is the problem, Amazon?

If you check that box, Amazon Music crashes. Every single time. I contacted Amazon about this but got no response."

I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future.

You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon.

I have perused new music, classics--lots of genres. The one and only hitch I see is that it's not always easy to pull up older music. Simple to get new stuff though, and since it's usable on lots of devices it's quite handy."

"671","Amazon","I Want a Divorce","Kirsten Karolle","December 21, 2016",2,"I thought I loved you Amazon, but it turns out you're just like all the others...No, really, I liked Amazon because it delivered clean MP3's to my phone that I could transfer to my computer using simple drag and drop from the phone/pc directories. This is EXACTLY why I gave up my IPhone and went to Android, to then find out I had to boycott Google Play too, who, as it turns out, is even more insidious at highjacking your music.I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I don't want to use a third party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely backed up,One last thing - Amazon was awesome too because it didn't conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never did but the Samsung music player did. Now Amazon, this messes that up again because now I have to get a 3rd party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN, then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it works properly in my car.Yep, I'm divorcing you. So disappointed."
"672","Amazon","Could do better.","Kayaker","August 3, 2015",3,"Puts songs directly onto device storage. Needs an option for putting music directly onto the SD card. I've been downloading a few songs at a time and transferring them - a slow process. As for Prime music - it seems to hide it on the device storage with no way of moving to the CD card - My phone was running out of storage until I realized this."

"688","Amazon","If you log out all your downloads go away!","Rachel","June 7, 2017",3,"While I am a huge fan of Amazon music unlimited, i learned something by accident that I believe people need to know about! If you somehow log off the app or get logged off, all of your downloaded music goes away and you're forced to re-download it all, and like a previous reviewer said, there is no ""download all"" option so you need to download them individually. Amazon needs to warn people about this policy, or change it!"
"689","Amazon","Will cancel subscription.","Amazon Customer","December 9, 2015",2,"Aside from the free delivery, the movies that are presented are way outdated. And I already have Rhapsody, so I have no use forAmazon Prime music.  I intend to cancel the subscription.  Amazon Prime, needs to get better up to date movies to watch.

The app Itself works great, loads fast and has little to no buffering. Another A+ by Amazon,  At the gym is my most favorite time to use the app, with my prime membership most all of my favorite workout songs were FREE to download!! I love the Amazon Music App!"
"693","Amazon","Guess I'll stick with Pandora","M Howard","January 10, 2016",3,"Pandora must buffer more or something, because they don't skip like amazon does.. It seems like amazon has to reload the music every time a new song comes on. Not seamless."

I guess this is a good deal, when compared to, for example, Spotify. You get on-demand, ad-free music, plus other amazon-prime benefits. Part of a bundle deal, if you ask me! Amazon Music is like the added bonus for your shopping experience on Amazon; it seems as if it were already free (but not really). Amazon Music is the cherry on top any ol' cake."

Unfortunately, a recent update to all Amazon apps requires them to be linked to one account. Now I have to choose whether to have access to my music and apps or to have access to my Kindle books which are on a separate account. Very disappointing, especially when you consider that Amazon does not all me to merge my two accounts into one. Guess I need to find a new music service."

It's nice that it is included with the prime membership other wise I may not have even bothered using it.You can download a few items to make them available offline or when your connection is spotty, but after a while they are removed and you have to redownload them.I mainly use it to listen to classical music, and I have been able to find three new bands/musicians which I really like and would not have known about otherwise."
"712","Amazon","I like prime music","J","March 1, 2016",5,"I like prime music.  Being able to stream and download music is really nice in the car.  You can can choose what songs you are listening to instead of a radio type app (like Pandora).  I haven't noticed my data use increase from other music apps.  The download feature is really nice."
"713","Amazon","What happened to ""Add to Now Playing""","Amazon Customer","January 8, 2014",4,"This was always a full 5 star for me (I use it on my Asus/Google Nexus 7).  With the last update, suddenly you can no longer long tap on a song or artist and ""Add to Now Playing"".  Very annoying drop, and no real reason to lose it.  Please bring this back, Amazon.  Knocked off a point for losing this feature.  Not super thrilled with the new interface either, but change is change as far as aesthetics.  Bring back Add to Now Playing (like Add to Queue from Google Play Music)."

WTF.then you have to click out of that to close it, and then swipe to get to next song.super lousy bug.  that alone is causing me to look for another player."
"723","Amazon","Not user friendly AT ALL","Hollis","December 4, 2015",1,"Very complicated app to use, not user friendly. I use it anyway to get the free music included with prime, but it could be SO much better.-It's difficult to create and add music to playlists. Also it doesn't allow you to have the same song duplicate times on a playlist, so you can listen to it over and over again.(iTunes does, for example.)-Search function is crap. Many times I have  typed the name of a song, album, or artist into the search bar, and it can't find what I'm looking for. But if I click and scroll around to find it, it's RIGHT THERE!-&#34;Repeat&#34; button doesn't work. It skips to the next song instead of playing it again.-Downloading music is weird... I always have to go back to the prime music store to double check to see if it downloaded. Sometimes it just doesn't show up under my device's music.There's probably more issues than what I've mentioned. PLEASE redesign your app, Amazon. I buy a lot of things off Amazon.com and I also use audible. With the amount of money I spend here, I should be getting a better app. And so should everyone else over here."

I love the music streaming but I don't like the movies and books prime memberships.  It doesn't suck but it isn't  good enough either.

There is comedy on amazon prime, but there is no way to search for it by genre. I find it irritating that I can only find comedians by searching for them by name. This needs to be improved."

"739","Amazon","Don't use it, don't need yet another competing source of music","JAAU","July 5, 2013",3,"I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying.  Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service.  Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.If they're going to ""DRM"" things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house.  If I ""buy"" an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it.  (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.And of course speakers on phones suck.So, Music?I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another ""source"" of music.I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service.  And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okay.  But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.So so so....If you use it, more power to you."
"740","Amazon","My favorite music service","Michael Hios","March 29, 2016",5,"The service is fantastic.  I really love the music selection and the ability to play what I want, when I want.  The mobile app can be a bit flaky from time-to-time, but that could be due more to my phone than the app itself.  This has replaced Pandora on all of my devices."
"741","Amazon","Best music app in any market","Michael Cesarz","January 9, 2013",5,"I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number."

The shortcut in the menu disappears so if you don't make a shortcut on one of your home screens you will be unable to open the app unless you open it from the appstore.

Then, you can listen to the songs in the order you want and how you want. No ads and no skip limits! Not all new songs are available yet, but the selection is pretty good. Also, the app has settings that let you decide what quality of music file or streaming you want to use (to save on data if you are using your phone's plan). You also get the option to download the songs over WiFi and listen to them later without using up your data plan.A nice feature is the option to listen to preset playlists based on type of music or mood that you are in.

My latest gripe is the ""download playlist"" button that loads a second after the button right next to it, which is ""shuffle playlist."" Several times now I've gone to push the ""shuffle playlist"" button and then the ""download playlist"" button loads into it's place. Now my phone is slowed down in attempts to download the playlist. When all I wanted to do was listen to the playlist! Rrrrrr. Sometimes I wonder if anyone at Amazon actually uses the product. I do, everyday, and I would love to help (re)design it.

Which made it useless since most android phones have what like 4 gb of internal storage. I've tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I'm one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I'm lucky the music will start up again with no interaction (like its buffering and this isn't me streaming. I playing the music I ""downloaded""). I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place."

So much ""free"" music (with your $99/year membership). I like the app, on my Windows desktop. I don't like the app on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) for 3 reasons. First, because you can only listen to three sources: Amazon Prime Music, your Amazon Cloud music, or music in your device storage. If you have a lot of MP3s, you either have to forget about them, add them to the cloud for a fee, or try to find them in Prime Music. If I had the ability to access music from a uSD card, I'd give the app at least 4 stars. As it is, it barely qualifies for 3. Second, you can't stream from the app to a wifi stereo receiver like with iTunes Airplay, and Chromecast is not available like it is for so many other apps. Third, the prime stations are absent from the Android (and the Roku) app. What's up with that? One of the best things about the Windows app is absent from the Android app? I've purchased a lot of songs from both iTunes and Amazon MP3, and even a few from Billboard and other sources. The Amazon purchases are available, the iTunes and others are not. I don't want to pay a second fee for cloud storage of all my music on top of the Prime membership just to listen to something I purchased elsewhere. I'm only able to access about half of my music with this app. Make it so I can have all my music on a uSD card and play it through this app, and I'll revisit my score."

When The new plan came out my choices of free music seemed to be greatly reduced, now I have to buy everything I want to add, not to mention the dropping off of songs I have already saved unless I want to purchase them. So I decided to try the ""Unlimited Music"" plan. So far it seems the songs I want are not FREE but have to be purchased. So how can this be Unlimited Free Music? I have read I can pay 10$ a month or 120$ per year and find a new music source. With Amazon Prime I pay 100$ and an added 80$ for ??? Add that together with the fact that many of the items I have been purchasing through Prime are more expensive than from other sellers on the internet I think I am about done with Amazon.

"937","Amazon","Good, But Greatly Needs Improvement","D. H. WALLENSTEIN","July 24, 2014",2,"For Version 4.0.4 - App gets the job done, and handily let's you access all content. However, player seems too simplistic to me, and more importantly, there is no option to deactivate the app's checking for cloud songs every ten minutes. This deficiency causes the app to monopolize mobile data.Recommend adding an option to toggle off the constant cloud checks, and improving player interface."

I live overseas, so it's even more important that I can use this in an offline mode without a network.  I was able to download my playlist to be used when I wasn't on wifi.  I just got back from a month traveling, and it was great to have my favorite music on planes, trains and subways no matter what I was up to.After I downloaded the app it grabbed all the music I've purchased over the years on Amazon.  I didn't have to go looking for them, I can play by artist, or album, but usually I shuffle through my entire library.  The app also doesn't drain your battery while playing music which is nice.  It's been working beautifully.I am using the app on a Nexus 5 phone"

The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside, it's one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there."

"958","Amazon","Incredibly Convenient","DJDD","July 24, 2013",4,"Having the ability to stream music on your phone directly from the cloud is convenient. It eliminates the need to manually transfer mp3 files from your computer to your phone. I have an aux input jack that I use to connect my phone to my car stereo, and the audio quality is better than that of Pandora. I have a JBL audio system I installed aftermarket, and so I can hear the difference between a high quality stream and one that has been compressed to save bandwidth. While not CD quality, the audio quality is still excellent.Caution: the app does use mobile data, so if you have a limited data plan, that is something you might want to watch out for. The app does remind you every time you use it unless you disable the notification. If you're like me, you probably have because you don't want to have to click ok every time you open the app."

"977","Amazon","Works great","Jerr Bear","July 13, 2013",5,"All positives, no negatives. I like the way you can order it by songs, and I also like how it has a link to the MP3 Store. I wish you could download your cloud playlists independent of the songs, but I suppose that's a moot point, unless... If they could make it so that anytime you are playing something from the Cloud, if it would automatically play the next song in the queue from your device if it's on your device, and then switch back to the Cloud for whatever isn't on the device, now that would be cool. If I think of something to add, I'll come back to it. Cheers, Jerry"

I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it ""clean""!!!

Really?I'm sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service.Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately 4 albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him.

I have reached out to Customer Service, but have not been able to get the issue reported correctly or fixed. Based on the reviews I have seen here, it seems I am far from the only one who has had this problem. If the app has received this many one star reviews in a short period and nothing is being done to fix it, it should tell us something."

Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you ""playlists"" of groups similar to the Doobies. So I'll get my ""South City Midnight Lady"" and the next song will be some other artist.Anyway, just the grumblings of an old geezer. :o)"

Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription!  It's all there, in one place.

I tried one &#34;Prime&#34; song today and it played ok, but if I paused or tried to switch songs it didn't respond, then after several tries it would perform the actions I'd tried in order sometimes 20+ seconds apart, so the track would go back to the start and play for a little while and start over, then it would play a little and switch to the previous track, then after a bit the track before that.  Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame!

I'd much rather listen to the whole thing (perhaps skipping songs) and then copy it to my library if I like it.  There are too many steps and too many delays in the current implementation."

I'll grant that.  They didn't have to, and that's a credit to them.But given that he'd just died, maybe for a few days you could have put his Greatest Hits up for free?  Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise.  If I now want to listen to Bowie I've got to buy it from you?  Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we're talking about here.I'll gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now.  Right now?  Might you not have just done a service to fans and put some stuff up for free?  For a few days, and then ended it?  Wouldn't that have been the high minded thing to do?"

The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing."

The awful thing about streaming music is you normally have to pay an arm and a leg for the music you want and if you don't like to listen to the same stuff over and over it's not really worth it to me. The other streaming sites that are free you don't get to chose what you are listening to. Normally you get to pick a station and they chose what songs come on. With Amazon prime music you get to chose what you listed to. There are songs included with prime and some you have to pay for. The amount of songs that are included with prime is enough to listen to so buying a song here or there isn't a problem. Especially, when you make a prime purchase and chose no rush shipping you get a dollar credit for digital purchases. I LOVE IT."

No option to move cached prime music (downloaded for offline listening) to external SD card.  Instead the app fills up valuable space on your internal device storage with encrypted media files.  I'm not sure why they do this.  It can't be for copy protection since anyone can easily copy the cached music (m4a files).  The files are encrypted and useless without playing them through the app as designed.Other major problems:- no automatic volume normalization.  Who wants to constantly turn the volume up and down with every song?- ""preview album"" function for listening to music I would potentially buy doesn't work reliably.  I have to amazon.com through a browser and preview there.- Cannot read reviews of songs/albums.

Ive been a prime member for years but finally switched from a KF HDX to a samsung tab as the fire tablets after the 3rd gen HDX became low cost budget tablets more so then they were.The app though offers a lot for prime music members and is very user friendly. Works perfectly on any device. Its even slightly easier to navigate then the inherent music app on the kindle devices themselves, due to an update on those devices that makes it more difficult to switch from online to offline downloaded songs. Great app!P.s - I still have my hdx, but mainly use it for music, as the sound is still better on my 3rd gen hdx than my newest galaxy tab s2, even through headphones"

"1372","Amazon","I want the old version back!","EAG","June 18, 2014",2,"The old version worked great, and I could move between songs without having to open the album song list.  On this one, there are buttons all over the place on my phone that SAY I can move forward or backward between songs [lock screen, a swipe on my lock screen, the notice screen, and even the ""now playing"" screen inside the app], but they don't work, either on the phone itself or while using it through Bluetooth.  The only way I can change songs is to open the song list, but if I want to listen to my current song again, I have to change songs first.  This is beyond annoying!  And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous, but ILLEGAL in my state.  I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do.  This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public.  It makes me regret downloading the update."

Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid.

When I tried to update my Amazon mp3 player, it just vanished, and will not recognize this new app. Now I have lost the ability to play any of my Amazon music on my primary player.

I like the lyrics part and the radio with unlimited skips as well as the radio stations. I like the option to be able to download playlist to use offline. But the player doesn't work when I turn off all my radios. How do I know it's really offline music then? After listening to music for a random period of time the music will just stop playing. I'll pause it and play it again for it to work for only another few minutes till I have to completely close and re-open the app. Not really sure what this BlackBerry/Amazon deal was but it sure was more in Amazon's favor then BlackBerry users.

On Monday, I replaced her old Moto X with a new Moto X, same gen, installed Music Store again, and started downloading all her music. Downloads were slow and practically overwhelmed my wifi with upstream requests. On Tuesday, all the downloaded (Offline) music files on her phone, about 700, were corrupted. On Wednesday, all the downloaded music files on my phone, about 300, were corrupted. On Thursday, tech support helped me figure out how to download the files again, because up to that point, Music store wouldn't let me download music files again. On Friday, my wife and I were driving 14 hours to Seattle. We verified that, even though we were playing only offline content, the app was still burning through my Verizon data plan. Her phone went through my entire monthly allotment in less than half a day. So I turned off data plan data. Amazon acknowledged the problem, said it's working on a fix, but has not yet offered any fixes. On Saturday, all the free content on both our phones was corrupted again, along with some of the paid content. For literally days worth of trouble, Amazon offered a $5 coupon. It's now Tuesday, eight days later, and this review won't change unless I hear from Amazon. If you're traveling somewhere and want to take your music with you, DON'T depend on this app.It's now Thursday, 10 days later, and the latest attempt to download music resulted in nothing but corrupted files. Interestingly enough, all the files I paid for are good this time, but all the prime free content is corrupted.So far so good. A new update installed, as of July 10, and we've gone two days without losing prime music. And just in case I didn't make this clear, the last two times the downloads were corrupted, only Prime music was affected, not the purchased music.I take it back. All the ""free"" music that I downloaded from Amazon for my wife is corrupted again. Am I paranoid to suspect that Amazon doesn't want its Prime members downloading and listening to free music. Why is it that only the Prime music downloads get corrupted, while the albums I bought remain playable. What is the point of offering free music if you then take it away after two or three days?"

"1569","Amazon","Great for prime music, horrible for your device.","LAC","February 6, 2015",2,"It does provide access to the massive online selections, but it really does drain your device.  Always running and killing your performance/battery. Force stopping it is a temporary measure at best since it always pops back up.  Linked to the amazon store app, and altogether, they are a mess."
"1570","Amazon","Amazon music is the absolute best! There are so many options","Amazon Customer","November 4, 2016",5,"Amazon music is the absolute best! There are so many options! I love my playlists and the fact that i can download to my phone for offline use."
"1571","Amazon","Amazon music did the trick for me","Scott A. Hutchison","June 23, 2014",5,"After having to listen to more and more advertising on Pandora, I finally gave Amazon a try and it was great. I had to install a couple of different apps before I could download it,  but once I did, we didn't turn it off all night.  And two of my friends downloaded it at the same time and both of them are now permanent listeners too. Good app."
"1572","Amazon","One Caveat","Dana Bohan","December 27, 2012",3,"This app is probably fine when performance is compared to Fire OS apps, it is probably fine when you are connected to the internet at all times, and it is likely fantastic when the lockscreen controls glitch out and flash repeatedly. Yet, when it lags, force quits because you are out of mobile range, and refuses to work with 4.2 lockscreens, I am forced to find a new player. For downloading music, however, there is no competitor in either selection or ease."
"1573","Amazon","Way better than I thought","Kyle T.","July 16, 2016",5,"Way better than I thought. After years of using Pandora, uuugh, the ads.  Love the Prime stations for genres. Skip all you like, repeat, great selection for any setting."
"1574","Amazon","Amazon cloud player sub standard forAmazon","SG","June 25, 2014",1,"After starting the player i listened to a few songs then opted to skip another. The player then was playing two songs simultaneously. I could not get it to stop. Every time I pressed play, i was listening to hall & oates at the same time it was playing simply red. I also couldn't find an exit or quit option. Never had that issue with Pandora."
"1575","Amazon","Good","Amazon Customer","May 10, 2016",5,"So far so good, you can listen to music that isnt normally played on internet radio which is awesome, and you can always buy a song if you like it i just like it for its better variety."

To my surprise, after I got the Amazon MP3 app, I was able to easily get my Amazon Cloud on my device and therefore listen to all of the music that I had already downloaded for another device.  It's easy to use and if you like music, Amazon is one of the best sources to find just about any MP3 you want."

"1594","Amazon","Ugh.","IMFletcher","July 14, 2014",1,"This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you didn't purchase from Amazon. If a sizable portion of your (large) music library isn't from Amazon, this app is worse than useless, it actually makes your music listening experience worse."

It would help to have a seed song that guides the following songs. Also,  not all artists are available,  so it makes getting started a little more troublesome."

"1607","Amazon","Pretty awesome","RaceMom","May 19, 2013",4,"We've moved all of our music now to Amazon MP3, after trying it out for a couple of months. It works very well, and it's really nice to have our music available to different devices via the internet...and not to have the music taking up a lot of room on our computer. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't always recognize songs from obscure bands and sometimes gives us trouble uploading songs if it doesn't recognize it."
"1608","Amazon","Clumsy","Kristen Evans","May 18, 2015",2,"I was really excited about Amazon developing this service. Then I tried it. It is overly complicated to use, has a clumsy, non-intuitive interface, crashes on my Samsung S5 phone regularly, and has issues streaming consistently. More trouble than it is worth, overall."

Match uses a cache folder and stores music as it is playing.  I just wish amazon would provide a desktop option for this app so you did not have to use the browser.

"1662","Amazon","Could be killer","Arthur Penn","November 12, 2011",3,"Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large (18K song) music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service won't allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and doesn't handle changes to playlists well."
"1663","Amazon","Fix this thing!","Crowd of Nevadans","January 23, 2015",2,"Sluggish and halting. It does not allow for personalized sorting of music. Well, that is not exactly true, you can organize your music which the application will completely forget the next time you start it. The app is the only way to enjoy the free prime content, so it pretty much sucks."
"1664","Amazon","Not too bad...","Chris Williams","December 23, 2016",3,"Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster (Formerly Rhapsody) out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you've already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I've found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the ""Downloaded"" section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the ""Unlimited"" category. Anyway, I gave it a try for 1 week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra $2 per month is worth it."

Wayne West","June 22, 2016",4,"The only complaint I have is at times it lags & the buffering wheel just inherently spins... waiting for that hamster to croak. The other complaints have nothing to do with the app or Amazon. There are a lot of obscure groups that I listen to, most of which are not in the library. some of the groups I like aren't allowing their material to be offered to stream. Therefore, THEY, groups like Metallica, can pucker up and... well, let's keep this age appropriate & kid friendly.Be prepared for music streaming to suck up some data. I use this while at work with my Bluetooth & it keeps the OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD voices in the office masked. I use it while mowing the lawn with my Beats which makes that 1 1/2 hour go by REALLY fast. This app is well worth the time to install and the music you can find from your favorite artists is worth searching for. Once you build your streaming library, it's an awesome tool to have for those ""I NEED SOME METAL TO SHUT THIS @$$&%$ UP"" moments."
"1678","Amazon","Close, but no cigar.","Amazon Customer","June 20, 2014",3,"Not quite as good as I expected. I expected more, if not all ""free"" music.

Currently the application use device storage to keep offline music. A few albums will full device space. Offline files are DRM protected. They could be stored in SD without any problem.- Clear SD space. After removing offline music the application does not remove files from storage.- Optimize memory consumption. I own a Samsung S4. This application use more memory than similar applications, reaching almost 100% memory usage.I hope Amazon implement these improvements soon."

I have not tried the mobile phone streaming app yet, but if it works as slickly as the desktop streaming this will be a nice option.Only thing I don't like is there is a pause between songs.

Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks."

I don't know about you, but I prefer to store photos & music on an SD card so as to not fill up the device's memory unnecessarily. Personally, I don't like to tote a laptop around just to listen to music, and I have an awesome stereo in the house, so unless I can use this on my tablet, why bother????So this is now a 100% useless service I am paying for. Besides raising the annual fee $20 a year, it's just another reason to not renew my Amazon Prime membership."

"1960","Amazon","Mac version of the Music Player is GARBAGE","Personal Robot","October 19, 2014",1,"The Mac version of Amazon Music Player is garbage, pure and simple. I can't speak for the Windows version, but the Mac version frequently (read: almost always) hangs for LONG periods of time before showing tracks in any section of the player. It also appears to use a lot of resources - I see system-wide issues while using Music Player, but when I completely close out of it, OS X goes back to behaving like it should. Now that we're forced to use this player to download any music we've added to Amazon Music, I've gone from merely irritated to absolutely angry. It is AWFUL software, and after several years dealing with quirks and outright problems with Amazon Music, I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this working correctly.Other ""fun"" issues:Badly matched songs (completely the wrong recordings - we're talking live songs being replaced by studio versions!) You can attempt to correct the match, but I have yet to get this to work well.MISSING songs! Inexplicably, some songs are just GONE from my library. Totally random - most albums are fine, others are missing this or that song, or maybe a couple. Infuriating.Tag editor destroys existing ID3 tags: if you dare edit any info in the file(s) you've uploaded, you will be rewarded with a downloadable version that has completely stripped out ALL tags. You won't know what song is what. ALL tags are empty, so there will be no artist to go by, no track name, no track number, no album name. NOTHING. This sounds completely unacceptable were it not for the need to rarely do this, but what makes it truly completely unacceptable is the fact that tracks in your library may randomly have their ID3 tags altered by either the uploader, whatever software runs on Amazon's servers, or the Music Player. And you're screwed at that point.Other than that, it's GREAT."

I like that I can choose ""Offline Music"" and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection (to my car stereo) is lacking. The full range of the music doesn't seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I'm playing to headphones and so it's cutting back on the bass a bit. I've found some (not many!) music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can't do that with the Amazon Music App. It also doesn't show the time tracking of the track that's playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they'd get on board with the ""Google Assistant"" programming and make it so I can tell ""OK Google"" to run certain commands within the app."

I cancelled other services that provided similat things and went from spending about $30 per month to just th $100 a year. The mobile music app is the best one I've ever had. Just this alone is worth the money. It is ridiculously user friendly. I actually crashed my phone within a couple of days because I couldn't stop myself and overfilled my memory. No worries though, dumped the entire song collection and what do you know? The entire thing was still in my cloud library.

Gibson","October 13, 2011",5,"This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. It's a real problem when you  create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated."

"2173","Amazon","What is not to like with this Genius Idea on behalf of Amazon ?","BLUESKYS4ME","June 12, 2014",5,"Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud won't let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for $24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes (I have comcast). I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go.Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You don't even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer.  My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. Don't get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job.So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again.Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app.It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !"

(Edit=>) For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently hasn't chosen to do so.But that's not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord (you can use the one for charging). With your Windows PC and android device on (signed on to both), both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC.  I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.Meanwhile, there is an app named ""Amazon MP3 Mover"" that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.[On copying my music from my PC to a folder [Music] I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear.

Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone."

I am a 17 year Network Engineer and do this kind of stuff day in and day out.  My PRIME account is useless but yet I paid over $100 for 16 months now to stream music.....no dice.  I want a refund.I have spent over $2,000 dollars on amazon mp3 music and I can't access any of it.

That data cap will get ya","James Yuenger","December 14, 2014",5,"When you have wifi Its my favorite music app, and just another perk that makes amazon prime great. Seriously hated paying up front but I love it now, pay once get it over with. And use the monthly payment you would have made to save for next year, you will renew. This feature along with all the others makes it worth it. The amount I have saved on shipping alone pays for it. I live in rural northern Minnesota free 2 day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I'm still poor :( but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I don't even download music and I hate him. Let the new guys bitch, you had 30 years prior to make a living."

My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...THE GOOD:*Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently.*I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone.*Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual App...THE BAD:*Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that.*Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it...*Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star.*I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I don't want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this app...You can do better Amazon..."

The user interface is nice and intuitive, and accessing music is pretty easy. If you are searching for music and something is not prime eligible, then asks whether you want to purchase it. So no 1-click accidental purchases.The biggest drawback is that you cannot control where the app stores the downloaded files. This is a problem because it saves the downloads on the internal memory which has very limited room. If it weren't for this I would rate this app 5 stars."

My breakdown after 1 day or so looking at it:I found it difficult to navigate the app, particularly with respect to what is included as Prime Streaming and what is not.  More specifically, it's frustrating that the ""Prime"" (i.e., no additional cost) music is sort of mixed in with all the stuff that is for purchase.With Google Play Music, it takes some effort to actually go and purchase something.  Basically what you find in Google Play Music streaming is available to you for unlimited streaming and included in your subscription cost.With this service, I'm wary that I might click on something and end up buying it.  Maybe that is the point, really.Amazon needs to clearly separate the ""free"" (i.e.included in Prime subscription) streaming music from the rest for this app to be very useful."

Didn't like that amount of memory usage. The phone seemed to slow down and the app itself locked up more than I liked. Also noticed it wanted access to a lot of areas on the phone it didn't need to access. Didn't like that at all as it's giving away my data usage and increasing my costs for data uploading data I don't want to give away. Then found out I couldn't delete it or uninstall it. That made me determined to remove it. Which I did by wiping the phone and reloading it. Amazon you want to much information, photos, media info etc. You are increasing my data rates with needless uploads I don't need to give you and you don't need. All that just to hear music no thanks there are better ways out there.On top of that the app isn't very intuitive to use.

You buy your music (the prices are very reasonable- to cheap) you download IF you want it on your device for anytime, anyplace listening. Or you can leave your tunes safe in the cloud so it does not take up any storage, you start the wireless and listen that way. Either way, the selection is nearly infinite. All the old classics to the newest hits....And best of all; NO Commercials!  And you don't have to listen to anything except what you want to hear. For listening on your phone or tablet, this is the real deal. No hidden fees. No upgrades. Just straight out jamming Your Way!"

"2976","Amazon","VERY basic, No user controls, Poor documentation.","A. Tubesing","March 25, 2011",3,"*** It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the ""cloud player"" so even though this app has the same name as the current one, there may be significant changes in how it works now. ***You can search, listen to samples, and buy songs with this app. However, there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one-click purchases to make it work.This is a very basic app, which is a good thing to some degree... that's what keeps it simple. I'm glad it's not trying to be everything under one roof. I don't want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However, it is so limited that it's hard to feel like it's easy to use because the limitations require other work-arounds.~~~Shopping Experience:~~~When shopping for songs or albums, there's no description, reviews, or anything else other than the artist, title, and a date (which is not explained--is that the release date or what?).Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. It's quite easy to search for a song, quickly find it, and listen to a sample before buying. It's great if you're not sure what song you're looking for.There are some strange things about it though. For example, several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name, artist, and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for $.99 and $.89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you're getting.There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one-click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet, but the way this works makes it seem as though there's going to be a separate $.99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my  balance without paying for each separately. I don't want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however, so I'm not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. It's all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I wouldn't have to commingle settings with my web shopping.Also, there seems to be no way to retrieve previously-purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? That's not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself, it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so-called convenience of the apps simplicity.~~~App Experience:~~~Because there are no user controls, you can't specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own (even after refreshing the media list) and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app, and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.Finally, the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self-explanatory (mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button), but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained, if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with, it's takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically, it's not a mobile-friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app, ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone, yet they're not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.~~Summary:~~~As powerful a site as amazon.com is, I'm a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now, I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer, and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I'm away from my computer and desperately want a song right away."

I can be surfing the Web on my phone or checking my email without listening to music and it crashes interrupting what I'm doing. Tech support says uninstall the app. But when I do this it deletes all the music I downloaded. Then it takes time to redownload my  music(have over 3500 songs) mainly full CD's. And not having internet at home this causes problems. Last time I did this it hijacked over 500 songs from another music from my other music player along with duplicating 300 of them(over 800 additional on my SD card). So I  hesitate to uninstall it again for fear of losing my songs from the other music player. In addition I  now have I have several CD'so that I purcased from Amazon that are now on my other music player. When it crashes if I don't select report the crash the music still plays, however I can't see what's playing. I have a Samsung S4 with 16GB internal  and a 64GB SD card.

The interface is not intutive and there doesn't seem to be much help.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I was unable to locate music that should have been obvious.  The Beatles, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, etc.  The music that seem to come up in the playlists is all new (2000 to now) stuff that I've never heard of.  Not that I stay on top of modern music much (I'm 61).  I might fool around with it some more to make sure I'm not doing something wrong but if I can't get the music I'm interested in I don't see the point.  I already have Pandora and all my music library on my phone.  I appreicate it that Amazon gave us Prime members something for free but for me the jury is still out on how much a benefit it will be."

And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall  yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to  purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

I was able to log into Amazon Prime at work and play my type music for free on my work computer.

"3399","Amazon","Where is the Fire TV version of the app???","Gannicus88","July 9, 2014",3,"I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums."

I start it again, get my band picked (on Prime, or my library) shuts down again.Since I've had the app, I spent a lot of time setting my playlists. Then you update and bam, playlists are empty. I've done that multiple times. If you all don't do something I'm going to migrate to a different company. I don't want to, but as another reviewer said, you have to try hard to make an app this bad."

It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect.

Prime members should take advantage of the free music streaming that Amazon provides! I haven't yet streamed music with the Amazon Music app without wifi yet, but so far it has been relatively smooth and the audio is high quality.The only downside is that it seems you would have to choose another playlist once the current one is finished, or else the music just stops. It is only a drawback because I like to listen to music for long periods of time and it is a bit bothersome to constantly pick another playlist once one is over."

This is awesome!I'm downloading whole albums of Blues, Jazz, and whatever else I want for free.

Now with no download status it's just blind guessing.Additionally, I can no longer skip back a small amount to listen to part of the song again. When I try now, it skips back to the beginning of the song so I have to listen to the whole song again. It's like a super cheap MP3 player.

There are already preexisting playlists, and you can create your own.  But the nice thing about these other apps is that it allows you to discover new artists or less commercially successful songs.  I don't know if not adding this feature was on purpose, putting them pretty much in direct competition with the sites/apps mentioned above.

With the newest version however, I have to downgrade my assessment and take away 2 of those stars because what should be a standard feature of any music player no longer works. The newest version breaks the shuffle feature almost completely- especially if you have amassed a library with thousands of songs.In the old version, when you toggled the shuffle feature, your songs would be played in a somewhat random fashion- as should be expected. In this new version, when you toggle the shuffle feature, a contiguous block of up to 500 songs is automatically selected, and it is only from within that block of songs that there is any randomization. I don't find this acceptable in the slightest.I like the new ""Play Queue"" feature, however when I enable the shuffle feature, I expect a play queue to be built that is completely random and could possibly include any of the songs in my library, not just a contiguous chunk of 500 songs."

When I'm driving, which is when I tend to listen to music, the music stalls and stutters.  I can rarely get through an entire song.  It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm playing music from the cloud or if it's downloaded.  Even the streams you've created don't work properly.  Very frustrating."

Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloudI was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!3) No gapless playback.Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience."

"4158","Amazon","Music must have app","Soccer Mom","August 19, 2016",5,"I needed music for a party for my coworkers retirement. They put me in charge of getting music and I was easily able to find it here on Amazon. That in itself is a blessing. Once I purchased the music I needed, I needed to download this app in order to play it. Normally this would suck and I would hate it but it's made everything so much easier. So I downloaded this app and it has the music that I have purchased right there. I can download the music on my phone so that when I am in the party, it's not using my data in order to play it. It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it's easily accessible and ready for use. It also adds my songs that I currently have on  my phone so I don't have to manually switch those over. Overall this is a great app, especially if you have prime. There are a lot of songs that you can get for free because of prime."

But after browsing the selection I end up downloading FIVE  mp3 albums. This was surprising because I still preferred buying hardcopy  CDs.

With or without letting me know. Sometimes, it'll tell me there's a problem try again, and other times it'll just stop and we'll stop. No warning. But other than that, I love that I can listen to full albums without interruptions though. I also love that I can search through Amazon prime to find more music as well while listening to music still. It shows whats available on amazon prime. Love that. A few fixes and then this would be a great app and would get 5 stars."

The user interface has a tendency to feel clunky and at times counter-intuitive. Search algorithm should be better optimized.  As-is, the system often just displays all the covers available through prime music without mentioning the original artist. This leaves the user wondering if the search went wrong. When someone searches for a song, it should display the original artist first, with track availability (unavailable, purchase-only, or PRIME).

"4529","Amazon","Unfinished Product","Biff Webster","February 1, 2016",3,"There is no music history, or way to customize the existing radio stations other than rating the song currently playing.  I accidentally thumbed down a song I really liked, and now will never hear it again since there's no way to undo this action.  Good design based on HCI principles should not allow for permanent consequences from simple user error.  It's also not well documented whether rating a song affects all stations, or only the current station - for instance, I may not want to hear Philadelphia on my Classic Rock station between The Who and Hendrix, but I may have a Rock Ballads station that it would be perfectly acceptable on.  Rating the song on one station shouldn't affect the other.  If this behavior was better documented, and a simple rating history feature was implemented, Prime Music could replace my Pandora One subscription since I'm already an Amazon Prime member. #AnthonyNaddeo - get busy and fix this for me."

It CONSTANTLY syncs the cloud library which seems to slow down the device way too often.  Buying individual songs vs buying whole albums causes issues when adding the music to your device, the streaming is really a joke and always cuts out if a stiff breeze comes along.  All in all this app is a waste of time unless you download the music to a personal library and play it from an app made by people who know what their doing. I bought 4 songs off an album, for some reason it didn't add them to my phone.  I tried then buying the full album to see if that would work and it downloaded all the songs but the first 4 I bought. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the songs to my computer and then transfer them, nope, apparently there is a problem with my download and all I am able to do is submit a ticket. Seriously amazon, I expect more."

I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a joke.  The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version.  It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store.  The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it.  Very frustrating and a big waste of time.  Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff.  This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time.  Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify.  ."

"4807","Amazon","So is anyone besides me upset? nay - mad?","Cynthia Raxter","September 25, 2012",1,"So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say ""Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!"" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - ""City ID"" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)After a month I was all done.Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said ""It's free!"" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot ""download"" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The ""Artist"" column can not be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: ""display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues"" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional ok?Last - the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a ""you must agree to this"" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!Yes. I am just that mad."

At the time of this review, I am currently using a Prime membership trial. I was hoping that Prime membership could help me alleviate some other services by using it. For instance, I love Netflix but prime instant video seems to have everything I need. The free shipping options with Prime in the market also make it a good purchase decision. I use google play music now and for one flat rate I can listen to as many songs or albums from as many artists as I want without having to download or buy individual songs or albums and I can play and stream them directly from the Play service cloud. I can make as many playlists as I want too. When I checked through this Amazon music app, most of the music I wanted to listen to has to be purchased individually and most of the albums have to be done the same as well. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on music. I will just stick with Google play music on this one. I believe they have it right. Still thinking of keeping Prime though. Just the shipping, Instant Video, and free book collection makes Prime worth it."

I would give it five stars, except that there are some artists and songs that are slow to make it to the collection.  Some of my old favorites from the 70's / 80's / 90's were in my original collection, but then were pulled out (i.e., Neil Young) and not available for ""free"" (I pay for Amazon Prime, so it's not exactly free).Just figured out how to download songs from my playlist to my cell phone to play offline.  This will come in handy to play in the car, since my radio is on the fritz.  Must have tunes when driving!  I just bought a holder for the phone so that I will be able to hear the music and advance through the selections hands free.Streaming quality is great.  I like the suggestions for other songs I might like.  Could use more indie selections."

This is what I learned.Prime is nice because any prime song can be put on the cloud or saved to your device for free. I was after an option that would not take up all my phones memory, but still allow me to have music on the go with or without Internet access.The songs with price tags are not free. The songs with the prime symbol are. So not every song you desire will be free but a good majority of my selection was. I have 178 songs so far and only spent about 5 dollars purchasing some songs that weren't prime approved.In response to my #1 experience I ended up paying .99 for the one song that was not prime out of the albums."

The iPhone 3s 64gig is where I downloaded it first. Loved it on the HTC Sence and kinda miss it. Then I upgraded to a Galaxy Note 3 which was also wonderful and easily integrated with the device.I now use a LG smartphone. Interestingly when I set up my new phone I logged into my google account and my ohine automatically downloaded all the apps I had previously installed... except Amazon MP3. It was just gone.Today I went to install the new Music app and stopped short at the privacy screen. Good g-d!I went back and read some reviews and it looks like I am not alone as far as being disappointed.DRM free music and general un censored control of my music is what wone me over back in 2007/2008Removing the option to save music and cover art to my external sd card is a huge deal. I want control.I accidentally figured out how to install the darn app only after accidentally figuring out how to install the prime video player extension to the Amazon app.It too damn hard to find for me and im somewhat savvy. Someone over there (maybe even sevral) needs to get there head out of there own doggy dish and render this app useable again.Relax the permissions and security it's just too much. I had to override my phones security to allow untrusted apps to have near full control of all my data. I call bulshit.Pandora had become redundant and boring.  Sootify crashes my browser and is unreliable iheart radio and last fm were also not good enough for me to change my routine. And now Amazon MP3 has gone all prism on me... sad.After 5 blissful years I want a divorce. Unfortunately for you I'm keeping the kids and their allowance. The whole family is now addicted to Google Play Music where we can search nearly artist song or radio stream and be listening in seconds. Its also much easier to purchase music and movies via the play store as well.Sometimes Amazon just needs get out of their own way, and take my money."

I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, ""which device is that song on?""!I LOVE IT!"

I love all things Amazon and the music selection and service with prime are good so I was excited to try the music unlimited. Unfortunately, the app itself skips constantly. I literally can't get through one single song without a skip. These are downloaded songs on TWO different phones, a Galaxy S3 and S5 so it's a streaming/connection issue either. App updates, cache clearing and restarts have not fixed it. It happens on both phones so it must be a problem with the app itself since it's the only faulty media experience on either. It makes the listening experience unbearable so I will be cancelling the free trial and looking elsewhere. It's a real shame they can't make this product work correctly."

It's a well designed program for getting your Amazon Music purchases to your phone.  And the player is...acceptable.  It plays music, and doesn't glitch up trying to do it.However, the more you use the player, the more you'll find it's not all you want.  You'll listen to an album, and then it'll just stop; it won't keep playing to the next album in your library. The interface is straight forward, but just slightly off somehow. You'll want to do one thing, and you'll accidentally do another.  You'll never have a MAJOR problem with the media player, but it's not the perfect answer.If you want something with tons of options and personalization, look elsewhere for your music app.  If you're looking for a way to get your Amazon purchases to your phone, and a perfectly acceptable player for those songs, stop right here."

There's no configuration option for changing the library location.While the application has settings that claim to limit downloads to Wi-Fi only, and to not automatically download new purchases, my experience has been that the application does NOT respect these settings. I learned this when I found my phone downloading a Handel box set I'd purchased, eating up the remaining internal memory on my phone and using my T-Mobile data plan to do it. If I wasn't paying for unlimited data this bug would have cost me a few hundred megs in overage charges. I tried pausing the active download, but the application kept chugging along, giving me no way to STOP the downloads.The application can't be trusted to do what you tell it to do. A search through the support site reveals Amazon has no apparent plans to fix these problems.  If you install it, be sure to have an unlimited data plan, or you WILL eventually get hit with a large data overage charge from your mobile carrier.I'm going to try and find a resolution for these bugs, but if I can't find one I'm uninstalling the application."

Plus Google play $9.99mo unlimited, so I was inclined 2stay but as Prime member thought I'd check it out. Prime perks R 5star, where else is it free despite limited selection.

I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time."

I shop with you all the time! Do u really need to gouge me for more money?I'll be downloading everything from my Amazon cloud and using the Google player."

(!!!)My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.(This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.).Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.(I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi).When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I'm at home, fine.  But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy)."

The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows.

Lots of great music, easy to build play lists. Trouble is that the app got to a point where it needed an update but every time I attempt to update it failed. This is true of the Kindle app as well. Per some Amazon and Android forums I cleared my app cache, no change, Uninstalled and attempted to reinstall. Now the app cannot install at all. I hit generic Android errors and there are no good fixes that I have found on any Android or Amazon search. Downloading from Google Play or Amazon App Store makes no difference. That said, it may not be fair to rate the App so low when it's possibly an OS issue but other downloaded apps are behaving normally."

Now you have to pay $24.99 a year for their service.  Don't get me wrong, if you want a cloud service, that's a decent deal.  I just wanted a good music player on my phone for music that is already on my phone.  That's all.  For giving me a nice player, they got my business when I needed to purchase a song.  But that is gone, and I switched to Google Play Music.  It will do.  I don't like it as much yet, but I haven't used it long.  And now they will make the money when I decide to buy a song.

After screwing around with my Kindle for  hours I spent another hour on the phone talking a total of four people from Amazon before I was finally told "" your device is not compatible with this update and you need to buy a new Kindle"".  WTF!!!!  I am very disappointed with Amazon and the deliberate omission of this piece of very important information.  If you are monitoring this Amazon, you dropped the ball and I will buy an Apple Ipad before I spend another dollar on any of your devices."

That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"

I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone (3.5"" phone). I also see that it runs a bit sluggish (1 ghz phone).Again, pretty good app and I'm happy with it. Hopefully we'll see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service."

This is the WORST. I sent a report but no response.Not only can I not use it. I also don't have access to my paid library of music because I the old app that DID work is no longer available from what I've found. Thus Amazon owe me a couple hundred dollars in music. They should have left the old MP3 app available til they worked the bugs out. But like most large entities this days it's about the bottom line not the consumers needs."

I know it is Amazon music because the stream from network works fine while the stream from Amazon jumps and cuts off songs. For the price and nearly unlimited number of songs it gets 3 stars."
"10940","Amazon","Garbage! Will not install","John Kirk","September 28, 2016",1,"This crap will not install! Tried numerous times, read tons of reviews of others with the same problem.  Amazon tech can't get it to work either.  This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also, they're consistently late but they're late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS, USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS.  ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!!  Love to see Amazon bankrupt"
"10941","Amazon","A Must for Amazon Prime Subscribers","Jaxon","October 27, 2014",4,"This is app is a must if you have invested in Amazon Prime and want to make the most of the music resources available.  Works equally well on my Kindle, Nexus  7 tablet and Android phone (Galaxy S 5).  Having access to a relatively rich and varied library gives the user more personal control than streaming services.  The pre-selected  playlists are entertaining and the ability to create your own playlists is good.  I primarily take advantage of the music that is freely accessible through my Prime account.  I have not purchased any songs or albums.  The app, itself, is clean, straightforward and easy to use."
"10942","Amazon","I really want to live this app, and I ss","Tamar Goldberg","February 21, 2012",2,"I rally want to love this app, and I did for the first couple of days - it has two odd the features I want in a music player: good lock screen and it remembers the last song that played even if it was closed for days.and then I tried the shuffle button on the songs list, it showed me 0 out of 0 songs and when I tried to get out of there it crashed. since I dint want to create a play list for shuffling over all my songs, this is more or less a deal breaker.I would also love to have the option of uploading songs to the cloudThis review is for the galaxy s2 on Sprint"

"10945","Amazon","Nice App","Jeremy M.","June 18, 2011",5,"Plenty of storage available for free. I  use it mostly for sharing access to my mp3s between multiple devices. Not sure how well the streaming works or how much bandwidth it consumes, but the are nice options to allow you to limit downloads while using cellular networks, which may keep you from getting an unpleasant data charge from your provider."
"10946","Amazon","Don't","Jason Ziegler","June 7, 2016",1,"Came to Amazon to download a single mp3 legally. Didn't get the song version right, cause the sample was too short to tell. Also I had to download an app to be able to listen and download song. Ridiculous! Already uninstalled!"
"10947","Amazon","This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left ...","Michele Anderson","February 25, 2015",1,"Where's the metal? It's all mainstream. I am constantly let down by Pandora and other so called music apps. I am a metal head who can truly recognize talent in any music I hear. This app is nothing but an extension of the over pampered, over rated, computer synthesized, failure of music today. This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left today that still has true heart. Sadly, even many of the hearts of this genera is selling out faster than American Idol can ruin the youth who watch and silently dream of this pop music crap."
"10948","Amazon","My music on my device!","August W McKenna","December 16, 2013",5,"I love that the music purchased from this app lets me choose what device I want to play it on.  Other e-music publishers, will only let you play their music on their devices.  However, I can purchase a song on my android, play it on my windows PC, and load it onto my iPod to listen to whenever I want.  Also, I am always able to stream the music (when data connected) from the Amazon Cloud.Keep it up Amazon, this is what purchasing all online media should be like!"
"10949","Amazon","Mostly great","J. White","October 15, 2014",4,"It's almost fabulous. I don't have an iPhone so I can't get my iTunes unless I'm at home. This app allow me to listen to my Amazon library while I'm out and about. My one star less is because there's no way (that I've found) to set music to a timer. I like to fall asleep to subliminal and binaural beat tracks sometimes, but I'll wake up hours later and have to turn it off because it just keeps playing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying my tunes :-)"
"10950","Amazon","Auto-Rip Rocks!","KS Rocks!","February 14, 2013",5,"I'm an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I'm still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it's still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I'm enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!"
"10951","Amazon","Convenient library streaming","Justin F","September 29, 2017",5,"Nice to be able to stream 250 of my mp3s. I would probably go for the expanded service if I had a ton more music I wanted to access remotely always, or if it was a bit cheaper."
"10952","Amazon","Love amazon music!","Amazon Customer","May 16, 2016",4,"Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I'm on a different ""station"" on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far,  is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I'm really liking this whole service and app!"
"10953","Amazon","A must have for prime members","Antsinthepants","July 30, 2016",5,"Excellent music app for prime members. Loads of free playlists and stations that you can stream on your phone or tablet. The app lets you add songs to playlists and your library."

"10955","Amazon","not what i was expecting","Kirby Gold","February 18, 2014",2,"To be honest i downloaded this app in hopes of getting free mp3`s after it was suggested from Shazam another music locater app. But sincei noticed that i would have to pay for sounds that i know i can get free even if there is a virus risk, i closed it and never bothered to open it or uninstall it. In search of a mobile app that i wouldnt have to pay for music, if there is anyone with info to provide me with please feel free.Unfair- it may be unfair that i rated it with only two stars but as i was disappointed the ratings showed."
"10956","Amazon","A piece of garbage","Camille Lambert","August 24, 2011",1,"App installation and buying experience is ok.What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning (interruption point was not saved)All this on our 2 phones (different models) so hardware problems are to be excluded.Really disappointed."
"10957","Amazon","Used All My Data...Battery Hog As Well","Zigzagmolly","June 23, 2014",1,"All of a sudden I have used almost 4GB of data. I made sure the app was set to download via Wi-Fi only and the next day another 2.5GB was downloaded. And the battery drain on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was amazingly slow...until I installed Amazon music and then half of it was gone in half a day with very little use. It appears it automatically syncs with the cloud every 10 minutes without any option for adjustment. Why would I need to sync every 10 minutes? Very disappointing. Uninstalled it from ALL our phones. Please fix these issues!"

I get ""exception 119"" or other playback errors.  This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.Getting a paltry number of ""free"" (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play....."
"10960","Amazon","Money Talks, Eh?","Phillip C. Holloway","October 21, 2014",3,"I think it's great although I would like to be able to download music to my PC or iMac rather than just my mobile telephone.  Since it's bundled with Prime Instant Video, I'm not getting my money's worth and should only have to pay a portion of the $99.00 that I'm being charged.  When I want to buy something, I'm told that I have to use a local credit card which charges me an exchange fee (I live abroad).  However, when I signed up, Amazon gladly accepted my U.S. credit card.  Don't you think that's a bit hypocritical?"
"10961","Amazon","Fantastic App","Camile Bailey","June 18, 2016",5,"I can't get enough of Amazon prime music.  The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app.  The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
"10962","Amazon","Great extra with the prime membership","Cinomod","October 31, 2014",4,"Great extra with the prime membership.  I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have.  I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music.  It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly.  I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."

AWFUL app","Laura Milburn","January 10, 2015",1,"It froze up frequently requiring me to pull the battery to reboot my phone, a brand new Samsung S5.  I never could get it to recognize my amazon account,  so I couldn't stream prime music or even retrieve albums I've purchased.  It was a huge resource and battery hog too.  After trying a second install and an update I gave up and deleted it.  Canceled my prime membership too."

I checked with Amazon and that's just the way it is.  Tough luck, I guess.  I'll continue using my subscriptions to Spotify and Panora."

I have this app on my phone and I can download whatever songs I want from my Amazon library. I can download music I've purchased from Amazon or songs I've uploaded (like the songs I imported from my old iTunes. Once the song is on my phone, I can listen even if I'm not in a WiFi area, and it doesn't need my data minutes either.

I  am bot planning on renewing my yearly subscription.  I believe that Amazon is doing this intentionally to discourage people and fix their money issue they saythat Amazon prime has caused them.

It is hard to keep up with the format changes, records, tapes, 8-tracks,and CD's. For instance....I hadn't listened to Joni Mitchell in years and found her music as delightful as I did in the 60's. I have a bluetooth speaker to use with my Android, and a computer connected to my A-V system and it has been wonderful to have access to so much music in an instant."

And there is no way to determine where to download it to (device vs sd card). How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that doesn't work and doesn't seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! You're better than this Amazon, I paid almost $100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!"
"10980","Amazon","Amazon Prime Music","Jeff","June 16, 2014",3,"I'm excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. It's early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I'm curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I'll go with 3 stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. It's Amazon, I'm sure it will be a great product in no time."
"10981","Amazon","Cloud Player was mind changer for me.","Nate Shapley","February 23, 2013",4,"Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I don't like ""Bloatware"". However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE."
"10982","Amazon","Nice to have some free download options as a benefit ...","Joseph Vallandingham","September 21, 2014",3,"Nice to have some free download options as a benefit for having prime; however, it would also be nice to be able to listen to those free songs through another music app i.e. poweramp. I understand why, but what good is having cake if you can't eat it, too?That being said, I think all other aspects of this app, based on my brief experience thus far, are wonderful and the average user/listener would really enjoy what it has to offer."

Android app user interface isn't as intuitive as it should be, and capabilities in general seem limited. For instance, the ability to shuffle across a collection of albums or a user-defined playlist doesn't exist or has eluded my search so far.That said, the audio quality seems fine and it's a nice added benefit that halps make up for increasing the cost of a Prime membership."

First off, the music I download disappears all the time and I have to redownload, which is a pain in the butt.Secondly, the music stutters when I try to play it via the headphone jack, which means it's practically useless to me since I primarily use it to listen to music in the car.Back to Google play music I go. =/"

I can easily download the content to my player (a Samsung Galaxy S phone that has been re-purposed into a media server) or stream it without difficulty. I would especially like more sorting and indexing options (it's very literal on the artist name - I would like to be able to do wildcard searches)."
"10989","Amazon","Fantastic App!!!","John & Sue Hofmann","February 7, 2013",5,"I installed this on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy S III (Android) phones and we love it.  All of the CD's that we've ever bought on Amazon were instantly available on our phones, either for streaming (which worked great and saves space on your phone) or downloading for listening when you don't have cell service.

I get to listen to my music, and buy new songs as they come out. I'm always listening to music. I just wish the app didn't take up so much of my memory."

Amazon is the most recent musical trip I've taken and it might be that I've reached my home for music.  I've been a Prime member for many years and it's paid for itself over and over.  This is just another reason my membership has worked for me."

I am a very firm believer in if you buy music it should be yours, not with a copyright restrictions and also only to be coded to be played by certain devices.

I am sure as time goes the catalog of songs available is going to increase.  Thank you Amazon!"

I had to manually go through and delete all of them which was a bit annoying. Other than that it works well."
"11035","Amazon","Is constantly ""looking"" for the cloud","Kevin Weaver","June 5, 2013",3,"The fact that Amazon has offered this app for free is great but when installed on a smart phone instead of wanting to play songs downloaded to the hard drive on the phone it always wants to go on the net to play from the cloud.

Yes, you can't natively download to an sd card, however your phone should have a file manager where you can export to an sd card. If you've ever used a pc or mac this should be a simple concept. It's just like moving files from one folder to another. Your music player apps will read mp3 files from anywhere on your phone. It would be nice to have the option in the settings in order to eliminate a step, but sometimes we need to do things on our own and use a little thinking to get there."

I had to redownload and resort the ""lost"" songs. Now it's done it again. It started by no longer reading the artist and album info, just the song title. Then it stopped reading the files altogether. Other music apps read and played the files fine. I see the song files on the card but the app won't play them. This time, my cloud too has only an odd assortment of purchased and already owned songs so i can't even redownload and there's no option to get the app to re-scan what's on the SD card, where the app itself put the files.

We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."

I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet.  This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had (meaning songs I didn't download from Amazon).  I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists.  I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device (why wouldn't they be?), yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I'm offline.  Even albums I've purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app.  I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, (System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc), yet for some reason the app doesn't want to play them anymore unless I'm connected to the internet.If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays.  But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for ""offline play"" if I can only play them when I'm online?  I don't know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for.  I'm not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I'm at work just because Amazon decided to break something.This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library doesn't work.  My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again."

I briefly tried Google Music, & two popular music streaming apps (Pandora, & Songza), and my Amazon Music experience has been infinitely better. I had a few technical questions initially (re: uploading my music, using PC & iPhone, etc.) that weren't addressed online, & support for Amazon Music was available right away, very knowledgeable & spot on (I now realize) as far as recommendations made.Now that I'm routinely playing music & adding or deleting individual songs from my library, etc., my impression is that more thought and planning went into the design and functionality of Amazon Music than the other options I've explored. It's very intuitive; graphics are very professional & consistent; it's very responsive (I've not (yet, anyway) experienced any lag or technical glitches); there's no annoying behavior by the app to aggressively ""encourage"" you to buy music unless you've expressed that interest; and - one feature I really appreciate - no ads (pop-up or otherwise). Quality of stream is excellent.My impression is that Amazon (wisely) realizes that this app nicely integrates with their business model, & complements their core mission; that is, if the app works well & people have a very nice experience, it becomes a very ""sticky"" service (i.e., enhances loyalty & overall impressions of Amazon, & encourages more people to join (or continue their membership with) Prime). In any event, they've done a very nice job designing & implementing this service (& accompanying app), & I'm really enjoying it."

I am a person who has a huge audio collection, and I own an echo, so I'm forced to use Amazon Music for my server to upload my music so I can listen to it on my echo's. This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can't use it at all. I've uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over 40K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I'm supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with 4 albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse. I hope they fix it someday, as I love the Echo... but can't stand this program."

This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it.  One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating.  The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists  that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library.  Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers.  It is truly a great value added service."

I expended over a $100 in your store to get a 128GB memory card.  I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesn’t allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded.  I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating.  At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, I’m in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone.  The start the whole process again.2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card.  Your app makes them part of the library.  Worse than that, I can’t delete them all at once or better,  just  delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone.  At times I had deleted over 20 voice mails one by one from the app library.  That how stupid it becomes.3. Same as #2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime.  I discover songs that I don’t like and I don’t know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.4.  I can't play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming.  When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a ""Exception #180"" codeIt is such a painful waste of time when you can solve that in less than an hour.

Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I'm stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music.  Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon.

Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service  providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it."
"11717","Amazon","Luv Everything Amazon","Beth E.","August 5, 2015",5,"This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH!  I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap.  Okay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music.  I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music.  Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight??  if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant.  The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device.  If u own the music u can download to ur device  (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data.  And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here).  it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this:  u can download aNY of the music u want.  However, u can only move the music you own.  Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it.  MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage.  Hopefully,  most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased.I personally think this is a great app & that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I'm a true believer."

And maybe the problem is specific to the Fire HD 10? It seems to work fine on my desktop - but I'm not going to risk testing it either since I'm talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists.After a few weeks of listening to my music offline, which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of CD songs, the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased Prime songs. Of course they are the ones I listen to the most. Flashbacks of digital rights usage? Clearing the cache does nothing, syncing does nothing. Support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists. Playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music - gone - poof!  The option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs. Transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the SD card with a card reader as the USB cable option hangs up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device. Oh sure, I remember which one is which since the last century.  The Amazon Music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolated and safe? It would make so much more sense to have those playlists synchronisable wouldn't it?Reminds me of when ms quit selling music, their player crapped out and amz stepped in."

While the latter is more egregious, both are unforgivable.  A few lines of simple coding (if that) would solve the problem but so far there is no indication that Amazon is working to do that. Are you? Hint to Amazon: ""free"" prime music is not free. Your prime customers are paying a hefty annual fee for the privilege. Second hint: even if the music is transferred to an SD card, which admittedly could allow easier movement to another device, Amazon still could code it to prevent access if the user is not signed into a valid prime account, so what does it matter? For your (tens of) thousands of customers who have limited data plans and devices with minimal internal memory, this is a huge problem. We are not always connected to wifi and therefore cannot always access your ""cloud"" to listen to our prime music.

Prior to Amazon Prime Music, I mainly used Pandora and Spotify. It is quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music caters to the white, middle-class, mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. As a millennial I am definitely more drawn to Spotifiy's playlists and classifications for genres.  I have a feeling I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1-year subscription. However, I was turned off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon caters.So far, I am thoroughly enjoying no ads and the option to download playlists, albums, and songs to my library to listen to offline. That is a big deal for me since I have a small data plan and limited access to Wifi. I'm definitely willing to tryout as much as I can on Prime during my first year of paid access.

"11726","Amazon","Bug ridden release!","Bhatta's Reviews","June 14, 2014",2,"I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer  service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.Thanks for reading my review."

I'll likely keep using it.

There is no way to move it to the SD card. Therefore, the amount of music you can have with you is bound by the unchangeable internal memory rather than an SD card which can be 32GB or larger.This problem has been known for YEARS.

Now I finally decided to try to download all of it (so I can put it in the car), and wow, what a mistake.I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I'm now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which shouldn't even be necessary in the first place, wouldn't be able to do its job. It's not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you'll end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50% of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been ""01. Track Name.mp3"" would end up just being called ""01. Track N"", with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I'm not paying for bandwidth.It's difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this broken program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they'll give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme."

It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service.  Why does the app not send this report itself?  Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again.  Today I was just trying to edit a playlist.  I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start.  I don't want to call customer service.  Oddly now as I poke around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?"
"11732","Amazon","I feel prime just made things worse for this app","C. Senn","June 19, 2014",2,"I like Amazons cloud and being able to upload (for free) your own music and download it on any device. While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, ok, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.I know millions of people are okay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?*In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC (which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library) I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.Pros:Not laggy and no bugs yetFree MusicGreat launch for PrimePop music for the masses.Cons:Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying.Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist. No I dont want to listen to Nicky Romero, Pitbull, and Armin all at once. Please add an intelligent radio program so to help you find music that fits your tasteUI is bit difficult and getting to the songs you want to listen to a bit tedious. Too much clickingadd/delete songs from playlists is confusing"
"11733","Amazon","There are better apps out there","Christina","September 27, 2014",1,"This app is an absolute mess.  If and when it works properly, it will only work that way for a short period of time.  For those who were familiar with Amazon's previous mp3 app (which worked great), this an ""upgraded"" version of that app that's just completely missed the mark.I will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud.  So if you have created playlists or Amazon Prime playlists, you can easily get those.  That's really where my enthusiasm for this app ends.My current issues with this app:- Freezing - This app freezes constantly.  I listen to music each morning/afternoon as I ride the train to and from work.  Each time I boot up the app, it will be at my last play point, freeze, give me the stopped working message, and then reboot again always at the Cloud/Albums page.- Unresponsive Controls - It happens fairly often where I will hit the skip button and nothing happens.  It's actually more like I hit it 12 times before I give up.  Finally when I accept that I can't skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past 12 songs.- Unresponsive Quick Bar - When in the Songs screen, the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works.  And it never fails, it always stops working when I'm on a song with the letter A and decide a song with the letter T would be better.- Playlists that don't shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it.- Always have to choose repeat and shuffle.  Sometimes, you just know the song you want to start with.  Every time I hand pick a song I always have to re-choose repeat and shuffle, or it will just start going in order.  The previous Amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection.I will admit most of my complaints are, when isolated, an annoyance.  But those annoyances occur daily and add up fast.  The only reason I continue to use this app is because I've invested a lot into Prime and Prime Music.  I will admit, Amazon has me over a barrel on this one.If you don't have a huge investment in Prime Music and you're just looking for a music app, definitely look elsewhere.If improvements and fixes are made to the app, I will come back and update my review."

With the previous version, I could log in on their device, download the song they wanted, and then log out.  They could easily find and play their songs.  After the most recent update, I can't figure out how to get to their songs without being logged in.  When you open the app, it prompts you to log in before you can do anything.  I tried just finding their music and playing it through android's music player, but amazon songs don't show up as music.  I was able to dig around and find them, but it was a hassle.  I can choose the amazon player to play each song individually, but the other functions don't seem to work.  I have to go through the file system for each song.  At least once I did that, my device recognized the files as music so I can use the android music player.  UGH."

Since the new update, it no longer connects to my Ford Sync, just bluetooth audio. The push to get people to pay for this service leaves the music that is provided to Prime members very lacking.

"11740","Amazon","Barely functional","Jennifer Gundlach","September 27, 2015",1,"This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo."
"11741","Amazon","let's you DL your music directly to MicroSD; still no gapless play or equalizer, still needs major work","cinephiliagal","January 7, 2016",2,"Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card, which I understand was a problem with Android, not Amazon (the problem occurred with many other non-Amazon apps).That being said... this app still needs major work.DLs of music I bought/own don't always work, but there's no indication from the app that they didn't complete. So you think you have the whole song, and instead you have only half or less.On top of that, it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song, because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.As a Prime user, I'm allowed to DL some Prime music I *don't* own for offline listening. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. The app won't tell you why.There's no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade, which this app also doesn't let you do.There's NO graphic equalizer. Again, there are free music player apps that do this!"
"11742","Amazon","Great music app!","Robert Stier","August 12, 2016",5,"Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off-line (airplane mode to save battery life) if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping.However since my LG-G3 updated last night (08-11-16), the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site. Thankfully, I still have it on my tablet."
"11743","Amazon","Great concept, but essentially unusable in practice!","Charles P. Lotz","July 7, 2014",1,"I am a huge fan and used of Amazon Prime- originally for the 2 day shipping and for the last year+ for streaming video. When the price jumped 25%, the general consensus was that Amazon would be adding another killer benefit to make up for it- and so it was when Amazon Prime Music was announced. I loaded up on albums I hadn't listened to in years, and marveled at the bargain that Amazon Prime represents.My daughter just got a new Android phone- a brand new, very recent model, relatively capable Android phone, with a brand new 16GB SD card (purchased via Amazon Prime!) installed. Amazon Prime Music was the second application loaded onto it- in fact it was a and she sat on the couch, delightedly perusing all the music she now had available.A few hours later the phone was staggering, and a quick check revealed the culprit- the internal memory was almost entirely occupied by Amazon Prime Music's data. Thinking that it ws just a matter of directing the data to the still empty SD card, I first perused the settings and then did some internet research revealed that this is not an option- the app only write to the internal memory. The 'Clear Cache' option helped for the short term, but the fundamental problem remains.It is a pity- this has the potential to be huge part of the cost-benefit calculation in favor of Amazon Prime. Instead, the benefit is essentially nullified, and one is let only with the (increased) cost."

It stops after every song so I have to go into the app and hit play whenever a song ends, there are weird noises sometimes when using this as app, and it isn't user friendly in any way. This app is garbage, it was coded by running thousands of rats over a computer keyboard. I would rather use a cheese grater to remove my toes then use this app any more."

Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well.  There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application."
"11748","Amazon","Poor experience with the amazon music software (5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400) for Windows","Phenomenon","November 6, 2016",1,"Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it took forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login.In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days.While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone.I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use! Hate it, when service providers waste my time!"

"11750","Amazon","How stupid is that","Paul Timos","December 1, 2016",1,"Amazon needs to make some major improvements to their Amazon Music App on the Kindle Fire series.  It does not work well offline (appears the buffer memory is way too small).  Besides not working well offline, you have to actually tell the Kindle Fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online... How stupid is that?  Can't Amazon's own app on it's own name brand device figure out if it is connected to WiFi or not and function accordingly?  I love the Amazon Music service concept, but the Amazon Music App currently is so sub-par.  In addition, when the Amazon Music App crashes, you literally have to reboot by turning off the Fire and then turning it back on again.  On both my Apple and other Android-based devices, in the rare instance that an app does crash, you can wait a few seconds and then just re-launch it.  Not so with Amazon Music.  To shame!Also, it appears that the Amazon Music App has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards.  I have had Amazon Music crash and then my Fire HD 8 suddenly can't read my name-brand 64GB SDHC card after the Amazon Music App crashed.  I've had this behavior happen many times... Then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card (and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen) again.  And then the Fire HD 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days, usually as long as Amazon Music App doesn't crash out again!!!  So that tells me it's not a bad memory card at all... Somethings wrong with Amazon's app / device.Overall, the Fire HD 8 Tablet seems to be an excellent low-priced tablet, but the Amazon Music App and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me.  Amazon, you're better than this, right?  Get your device and app teams to fix this or I'm moving to Spotify and likely never coming back!"
"11751","Amazon","If this gets better, maybe it can rise to mediocre.","Bob Powers","February 24, 2016",1,"Mediocre at best.  The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information.  You are forced to try one-- and if it's absolutely horrible to you?  Too bad-- the stupid app thinks you *liked* it, even if you only listened to the first few seconds of each song, before clicking ""no"".. and after 3 or 5?  You realize that station is not for you.But.  The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck!  Horrible!A simple description under each station is too much to ask?  Or even just a category label?  No?  As if I'm supposed to recognize these people (after which the station is named... right)?I'd love to learn about new artists--  but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge (i.e. ""cow hard country""... makes me ill).Where is a FILTER for the prime stations?  I don't care what is popular!  I just wish to eliminate musical styles I find objectionable-- but there is no way to do this in this app.One star, all but useless."
"11752","Amazon","No External SD Support = Useless","virtuadept","May 24, 2013",1,"This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?"

As a result (like other Amazon apps), they all take up so much memory in a limited memory phone that it makes it impossible to use.Overall, on other platforms, I don't find it as versatile as Pandora in finding music, building playlists, or creating ""stations"" of my own.  At this stage, I am staying on Pandora."

It doesn't let you play it because you have to deregister your old devices on Amazon.com from a web browser. But you have no way to register a new device. So Amazon Music will give an error called ""Ah fiddlesticks"" which means... awe, our music software can't play the music you paid for on your new smartphone.Oh and then, it says that you have to buy a Kindle or something like that in order to register your new device.

There is no way to auto-play music on bluetooth connect.  When I start my car, I want my music to start playing as soon as BT connection is established.  The Amazon Music app does not support this feature.  I have tried using other apps (Bluetooth AutoStart and others) and can successfully LAUNCH the Amazon Music app on bluetooth connect, but I am not able to PLAY music unless I unlock the screen and select the music I want to play.... Well.. If I already have Amazon Music App running on the phone, it will transfer over to the car and keep playing, but, that's only if the Music app is already running.For example... Black Player music app will auto-play on bluetooth connect from a cold start.  Black Player doesn't need to be running.  It just recognizes the BT connection and starts playing the song that was last played when it was turned off.  This is the way a music app should work... of course you should have a setting to be able to turn off this feature if you don't want it...If Black Player can do it... why can't Amazon?"

I am no stranger to downloading music, I've been doing so since the Napster days.Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. It's bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure ""oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me!"". Wrong. It's genuinely terrible.Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them (oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS) I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history.

Stations and playlists are not curated/updated.  Unlike Pandora or many other music services, the stations and playlists on Amazon are pretty much the same.  For instance - any time you start the Classical station, the first tune played is Yo Yo Ma - EVERY TIME..  Amazon really needs to step it up in the curation management of their stations.2. Variety of playlists and stations suck.  They have the generic genre stations and then they have stations by artist but there is no ability to select 3,4,5 artists and have the site dynamically create playlists/stations for you.  I miss this feature the most from Pandora and find myself going back on occasion (with commercials) just to find different music that is similar to the music I already like.

"11768","Amazon","App Designed By Someone Who Has Never Used A Music App Before","George Vazquez","May 26, 2016",1,"I really want to love this app.  I really do.  Having legally free music is appealing and having good recommendations made has certainly increased the library of music I'm playing.But this app is absolute garbage.  It was designed by someone that never has used a music app before.  Maybe it's my phone?  I have some spare cell phones, I'll try this on to see if I experience the same issues and update my review.For reference, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (t-mobile variation) and I'll be testing it on my Nexus 5 (old model) and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (T-mobile variation) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 if it powers up.So here are the huge glaring issues with this app and service:1)  You can only upload 250 songs to the cloud.  That's pitiful.  Amazon is the damn king for cloud computing.  I refuse to believe they can't easily and at low cost up that number.  Google play music (which I was using before) let's you upload 50,000 songs.  A 250 limit severely restricts us and I refuse to rebuy my music catalog from amazon mp3.2)  If you add more music to your playlists from your computer, and you hit download on your app instead of it just downloading the new tracks you added onto the same playlist (ie Favorites) it creates a new playlist (Favorites 01) it doesn't redownload everything, but it's a nuisance.  In a year what will I be at?  Favorites 69?3) Why can't think app sync with the music app on my Amazon Fire Tv?  With google play music I can connect to google play on my chromecast and play my music on my surround system, I want to do that on here as well so I don't have to constantly skip tracks I've already heard recently.4)  This is the by far the biggest frustrating issue for me.....and related to # 3.  This app has never once played a playlist all the way through.  And it is INFURIATING.  What's the point of having a 800 song playlist if it keeps restarting!?!  I listen to music on the way to work and I'll get to track 8 of 800 and when I drive home in the afternoon I should be able to resume on track 9 of 800.  But it doesn't.  It. Keeps. Restarting.  So I spend most of time skipping tracks, because ""i just heard that this morning, heard that yesterday.""  Google Play Music never once had this issue.I want to hear a playlist all the way through.  I want to get home, sync the app to amazon fire tv and listen to music as I wash dishes, then go to the gym and continue my playlist.  And I want to not have the playlist keep starting over again every time I open the app.I switched from Google Play Music because of the allure of all that free prime music, and it has introduced me to some really great stuff I'd never heard before.  But the app is currently a broken mess."

Now I am left to buy the music for a different source because the Amazon music app is no long supported on my non Amazon devices.

"11770","Amazon","Well behind Apple Music app. Hoping improvements will come soon!","Steelerfan#1","June 7, 2017",3,"The app needs some improvement in order to make it more user friendly. It has a very generic setup. The biggest pain is getting your library move over from another service like Apple Music. It's not easy if you have playlist you want to keep in place without having to make new ones. Sorting is limited, very limited columns selections in your songs catagory (roughly 2 choices vs Apple Music has over 40 choices). It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no option(or a way) for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price. Amazon does offer 2 months off for a full year subscriptions vs Apple which offers no discount which is why I decided to give Amazon a try."
"11771","Amazon","AVOID.  Do not become dependent upon Prime Music, you'll be sorry","Bob","June 16, 2014",1,"UPDATE:  I now have the Galaxy S7.  And guess what?  This app is TERRIBLE.  The ""update"" causes my playlists to stop after every song.  It will not recognize my downloaded music library (4000 songs, and this app can't find ONE of them).  And tech support is non-existent.  I've reinstalled 3 times.  I've uninstalled the update twice.  I've refreshed about 10,000 times.  Nothing helps.  And I was stupid enough to upload my music to Amazon Cloud and build playlists from Prime Music.  I think Mr. Bezos should refocus on his company rather than the Post or space junk."
"11772","Amazon","For a simple app, it is really not that good","L. Briner","May 17, 2014",2,"This app only does a few things, it's basically a music player with a built-in store. Being someone who uses Amazon Cloud Player, I expected this to work like a breeze but there are all kinds of problems.The main one is that across both this app and the Cloud Player, Amazon have a pathological problem with track ordering and identifying albums which has STILL not been fixed. Talk about keeping the main thing, the main thing, I can't imagine how they can't fix it. Uploading tracks from iTunes to Cloud Player lose their track ordering because some of them get the year and disc number and some don't. Album artwork that is taken from a completely different album even though the tracks I've uploaded all have the correct tagging. I thought this was perhaps a Cloud Player issue but......nope. This app seems to have the same problems. Take Presto, an album by Rush which I uploaded from iTunes. It broke like most albums did so I had to reset the tags in Cloud Player to make the track listings work and now they are correct. I recently bought a new phone and got this app, downloaded Presto from Cloud Player and....the app thinks it is two different albums so now if I want to play the whole album, I can't without creating a playlist. One of them is listed as Presto with the srtwork from Presto and has 3 songs on it and the other is also listed as Presto but with the artwork from Chronicles with the other 8 songs on it.How on earth have Amazon mucked this up so badly? They are supposed to be kings of online sales and probably sell a large percentage of the online music market but this is basic cock up 101. The fact it has not been fixed? Fail The fact that this occurs on two products? Fail The fact that it happens on the app even when the tracks are supposedly downloaded from Cloud Player which is setup correctly? Fail The fact you can't even force the music on the app to go to the correct place? Fail The fact that the app thinks that Presto by Rush and Presto by Rush are two different albums? Fail.Also, the tracks sometimes reset back to the beginning when playing.The only reason I don't move to another service is that iTunes and Google Music don't sound much better. There is NOTHING actually keeping me with Amazon other than that."

I can't believe that amazon finds it acceptable. Music will often not load or the app will crash out mid session, if you make a playlist that has online and online music it can't play offline (just skip the online). I will download music and it still acts like it online music only. The app will turn on randomly and play music (happened once in a meeting which wasn't cool). In addition its painfully hard to exit the program on your phone, its like one of those bloatware apps that just wont go away once you opened it. It is easy to find free music or purchase music though and works on both iphones and androids. The iphone app seems to be less buggy then the android (no surprise)."
"11774","Amazon","I hate it :(","MrsSeniorChief","October 26, 2014",1,"It's cumbersome. It forces updates that don't automatically install on my system so I have to go in and download the entire thing again and install it in order for it to run properly (Windows 7 Ultimate). It doesn't allow me to choose where on my system I want to save the music, and it invaded my privacy before I could choose my preferences/settings by going through all the existing music files on my computer (most of which are NOT from Amazon) and making a playlist for me... While I like Amazon for a lot of other purchases, particularly Kindle books, I'm not buying music from Amazon anymore. Going back to iTunes."

Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold.  The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device.  This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper.  And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it.  What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon."
"11776","Amazon","Nice, but a few usability issues","Dave","September 28, 2017",3,"It delivers good sound but I have noticed that searching for stations from the app is much less user friendly than the webpage version.  Also, every time you touch something, it starts playing and then gets added to your Recent list.  I cannot remove the lullabies station from that list, which uselessly takes up precious real estate.  The other thing that is making me debate uninstalling is that it keeps starting on its own.  After I have shut it down, by pressing the X, it keeps starting itself up again.  After 5 or 6 closes, it stays closed."
"11777","Amazon","Having the correct album covers matter!","Tom","March 1, 2015",1,"Why Amazon can't get album covers right is beyond me.  They use Gracenote.  So does Apple where I rip the CD.  Apple gets it right but when I upload to Amazon they can't get it right.  I have spent hours on hours trying to correct album covers.  Just gave up.  There is an easy solution.  Let me update the album cover on your website like Google Music does.  What I have learned is that if you adjust music titles or album names, you might get the right cover to show.  Also, having the right cover on the website does not mean that the right cover will show up on a Kindle Fire device.  Or, it might be wrong on the website, but will be right on the Kindle Fire.  Go figure.  They have until my subscription expires to fix this.  Too many other services that get it right to keep paying for this one.  Apple gets it right.  XBOX music gets it right.  Google gets it right.  When all three of these services don't, they let you fix it.  Amazon does not, you are stuck with what they give you."

The latest update ruined what was better than iTunes.  I have this on my iPhone because I used to like it better than iTunes.  It was much easier to navigate while driving.  The latest update ruined that.  It is now so complicated and counter-intuitive that I can't even really use it while I'm driving.  Since I spend about 20-30 hours on the road every week, that's a problem.This latest update didn't even fix what has been the biggest problem with the app since I have used it.  It treats compilation albums as though each artist is a separate albums.  So instead of one Christmas album with 14 songs, in the albums list, you have 14 albums, each one song in length because of the different artists.  Ridiculous!Other issues I have had since the update include losing individual songs from albums that were uploaded from CDs.  Jumper from my Third Eye Blind album just vanished from the middle of the album.  No other songs, just the one song. Go figure.  What's worse, is that albums that I purchased from Amazon disappeared altogether.  For example, I had purchased the full version of Maroon 5 (the Animals album) along with the lyrics book.  Since there is a ""Prime"" version of this, all of a sudden, I had the prime version with no lyrics book.  I was able to re-download the version I had purchased but it still sucked to discover that on a three hour drive and no time to pull over and figure out what the hell was going on.  Because it was the prime version, it wasn't in my normal list of offline albums.  So initially it looked like it vanished altogether.The controls are my biggest issue with this new update.  What used to be simple, straight forward controls are now ""fancied up"" to the point where they are almost as dangerous as texting to try to used while driving, especially trying to switch between albums.  The menu defaults to settings instead of just sticking to my offline albums list.UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  I just clicked the app to double check what I am saying here and all of my albums are gone.  Literally all of my music, except, oddly the one song that I have purchased from iTunes recently.  THAT song is still there.  Everything else is literally wiped out.  I'm done.  I'm going back to iTunes.  Amazon, someone needs to be fired for overthinking, over-engineering and just throwing a bunch of bells and whistles at this app, instead of fixing the actual problems with it."

The app itself is pretty looking but the functionality is average and the music service itself is below average.The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app (Pandora, Slacker, etc.) is much better in every way.The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible.  My guess is that it's because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they'd have to pay the artist and don't want to in a ""free"" service.  Example: The other apps have a ""top pop station"" where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent.  Amazon Prime Music - not even close.  Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts.  I'd add say it differently....they're created by experts who are limited by the music available."

It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever.  I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels.  Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora.  Other than that, I like this app,  I can pause, skip and shuffle.  It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working."

My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the $14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Looked in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. Wasn't getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I don't have a 3 month credit so we weren't able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. ""Credits"" don't seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo weren't worth their cost. Wouldn't recommend it to friends. Giving it 2 stars because it could at least play the majority of specific songs or artists that I requested but then again, other music services have had this figured out for years. I'll be sticking with Pandora."

I did call and did get to speak with a rep who informed me there is no exit button in quick fashion. Thanks, that answered my question. That is all I wanted.The whole thing is that every other music app I have on the phone has an ""Exit"" button available in it's menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? Better believe it does. Free Radio? Sure does, though it can be a bit clunky at times. Heck, even Anime Radio has an ""Exit"" button that shuts down the app.But this app? Nope!That is a serious flaw. Caused me to get rid of the app. It took using the Unistall menu option rather than just dragging it to the trash can, but at least it is now gone.And good riddance.If they ever get their act together and put in an exit button, I'll reinstall it.Perhaps Amazon just ought to stick to what they do very well, namely selling stuff and forget services.This one sucks due to the one fatal flaw."

"11790","Amazon","The latest release of the best 50 Beatles hits is terrible because the sound engineers ...","Dr. R. R. Hilton","December 25, 2015",5,"I am revising my assessment in the light of developments. My original harsh assessment was an accurate reflection of my displeasure of the reproduction of the newly released Best 50 Beatles'  Songs. Playing them back via an Amazon  Fire TV module to a Sony TV the tracks were a mixture of passable although degraded with respect to CD quality,  but in others the voice track was entirely missing or so weak that it was hardly audible against the instrument background. My original reflex was to blame the sound engineers for sloppy control.  I would now like to retract this negative assessment as I have found the cause although I don't understand the detailed mechanism yet. So I am writing this just in case others come across something similar. Let me add this only occurred on these Beatles tracks so I was fixated that it was the new tracks that were at fault.  Well it appears they were not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamined the audio settings of my TV.  Not those with altering the frequency response but ones connected to the speaker system. On changing my system to a dual system set to stereo voila the full tracks were reproduced. How this change can affect the selection of tracks within an individual tune I fail to understand. However I submit these details so that anybody else that is having such problems might investigate their own possibilities.  I have also revised my star  rating accordingly."

I've stopped using Pandora altogether.  Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it.  The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time.  Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else.  Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great.  Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora.  I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release!  If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion.  I don't believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see.  I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library."

Argh!The product listing says it only requires Android 4.1 and both my Fire tablets and Fire TV have been updated to have OS versions based on Android 4.1 or newer. I'm blocked from even purchasing it (at $0 of course). Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!Maybe I shouldn't complain as the old app works fine for me. On the other hand a lot of good music seems to be disappearing from Prime music and I expect the added cost music subscription may be needed in the future to get good tunes. Just feeling a little dark at a good thing like prime being eaten away in parts I care about.I hope Amazon isn't blocking all older devices from new apps. That would be bad. I'm giving this app only 1 star till this gets resolved, if ever."
"11794","Amazon","What happened????!!!! (Updated)","Amber","November 10, 2016",4,"Updated 11/16/16 - I updated all of the drivers on my Dell laptop and now this app is working. I was having issues with my laptop waking up when I moved it to and from the docking station. Updating my drivers fixed that problem and appears to have fixed the issues with this app too. I also un/reinstalled it several times. Upon opening it for the first time this time, I didn't dismiss the banner for signing up for Amazon Music. I don't know if that is why it's working or if it truly is the driver update. I wanted to add this though in case it will help anyone else. :)**********************I used to love this app. My work won't let us have iTunes and now that it's been updated, it barely works at all. It freezes then fast shuffles through my playlist without actually playing any of the music. I have uninstalled/reinstalled three times to no avail. Also, it's messing with other programs on my computer now. I thought maybe it was something that happened to my playlist but I can't play anything. Opening/closing doesn't help, creating a new playlist (if I can get it to work long enough) doesn't work. Streaming from Prime doesn't work. It's causing me to waste a lot more time at work than I really have but I can't work without my music! This is all stuff I've purchased too so it's not like I am trying to get something for free or streaming pirated music or anything like that. I buy all of my music from Amazon. This is soooooooooo disappointing. Help! Isn't anyone reading these reviews that can fix it?"

Just to address the playlist aspect (although there's plenty more that stinks).  First I tried to import playlists from iTunes.  It had the names of them OK and I checked all the boxes - but they never were imported into my library for Amazon Music.  Not the songs in the playlists, not the names of the playlists themselves.  Then I tried creating playlists in Amazon Music.  I could create them OK - but when I tried to add songs by checking the boxes, it would do things like add ALL the songs not just the ones checked.  Then scrolling down the alphabetical list I'd check a song or two to add to a playlist - and the screen would inexplicably refresh, erasing my checkmarks, and re-setting to the beginning of the alpha list.Whoever they had developing this software, they should fire them.  Whoever they had testing it, they should fire them.  Oh, they should fire the designers, too.  It's clunky and it doesn't work."

So I go to create new playlists, but now the app REBOOTS MY PHONE after four or five songs play! I'm sure it is the fault of something else though, which explains the new player I downloaded played around 20 songs without missing a beat! Gee, I wonder where I should create my playlists? But Amazon Music does play music. It appears that the bulk of their programming efforts are in support of cloud access - I'm guessing, as I only stream music when on my wifi, and even then only occasionally.

I am going to look for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose how/where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I can’t spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. It’s the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered.

Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.Pros :Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon appManaged playlists are nice, good varied selectionLots of good music in thereCons :Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library - no way to disable this - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again) - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scanNo way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely.Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks.No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as : - specify download location - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music - disable device scan"

I love classic country from the 60's through the 80's and there is a great selection available! One thing I find slightly annoying about Prime is that you pay a premium for the service. Then Amazon gives you what appears to be a partial service with an ""upgrade"" available for another few dollars a month in subscription services. Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the Prime product, but the ""upsale"" attempts are annoying and make me feel as though I've been played by Amazon.

I notice there are several of the song in My Music that are no longer available to me and they have designated a lot of the more popular stuff to the ""music unlimited"". Amazon should have at least allowed existing Prime members access to the same service they had prior to making the change. We will most likely be cancelling our Prime membership."

But I am continuously stunned by how Amazon continues to pour cold water on the already sputtering flames in their app store.  So many apps sit years without any possibility of a new update in sight.  Sure, those 3rd parties aren't pummeling me for data on every aspect of my life... But that's probably because Amazon doesn't want to share.Regardless of that fact, I cannot fathom why, on the heels of their announcement regarding their new Fire Phone plus all of the rest of their attempts to draw consumers into their ecosystem, they would not have a proper update for their Kindle Fire customers.  Not only does their weak app store show how they're catering only for the elderly-monied-suburban-dumb-phone-devotees, it also demonstrates how once they have those dollars they will make zero effort to be a useful platform."
"11810","Amazon","Downloading Purchases Is Slow and Painful","Technology Guy","August 2, 2014",1,"I'd been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new ""upgrade"". I don't have Prime so I'm not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music  V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old (non-Prime) version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. There's no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone (the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it wasn't easy weed out the duplicates).Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.UPDATE:Even worse than before. I'm lucky if I can get ONE purchased song to download to my phoneDownload Failed. Error: 1000THIS APP IS COMPLETELY BROKEN"
"11811","Amazon","Should have left well alone, the 10/2016 upgrade is terrible","D. SHARGEL","October 8, 2016",1,"I've used the music app for years, mostly the iOS version and a few months ago started using the Fire Tv/Stick version and thought it was all right.  The version just released recently is absolutely horrible however.  No longer can you click on a song and select ""artist"" or ""album.""  You just have the option to play it.  A quick way of playing an album I recently purchased or uploaded was to just find it in the ""recently added"" playlist. Now you can just click on an individual song and listen to the entire playlist.  What is really egregious though is when you go to ""my music"" you can get to your songs, artists or albums and they are in alphabetical order as before but what is missing is the alphabet menu shortcut we had before where we could jump to an artist like Joyce Manor for example, just by quickly scrolling to the J.  Now you have to scroll through each individual artist name by name which if you have a large library can take quite a while.  I feel like I'm being pushed by Amazon into relying on playlists and using the music app as if it was Pandora or something.  I prefer my own library and that's what I want to play but this app makes that more challenging."

All the music I own is through Amazon, plus I'm a PRIME member, so I should be able to play all the PRIME music for free. But it's not working out. Music I've bought and paid for is downloaded onto my phone and then immediately deleted without my permission. PRIME music won't play. And other songs that I've deleted from my phone keep re-downloading - again, without my permission. And other songs that do play when tap on them individually, won't play in a playlist. It's very frustrating. I've deleted and re-downloaded this app several times, but nothing helps. And every update makes things worse. I just want the original app back so I can buy and play my music!"

Your own playlists are unavailable, unless you want auto-generated playlist of what Amazon thinks you want to hear. Cannot use voice commands properly, either. Most times, if it responds at all, it gives you something wildly different from what you asked for. This is basic functionality and has apparently been broken for some time or has never worked. I know Amazon and Google don't play nice with each other, but removing basic functions from their service is ridiculous.

However, I took off 2 stars because of a single (and annoying) bug. With Prime music, one can select certain tracks to download and play on this app. However, the app tries to play songs from albums where I've downloaded other songs. For example, if I download ""My Life"" from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, it will try to play ""Only the Good Die Young"" even if I haven't downloaded it. This causes the music to stop and I have to correct it. Sometimes, I even have to go back and start the shuffle again. Yes, it's on music from the device only so that's not the issue. I hope they fix this soon."

Then, there is Sound Quality and WiFi vs Cellular ( Tidal and Spotify) for SQ and (Pandora and Spotify) for Cellular.Then there is the Skip limit thing which drives me nuts, you have to have Teen age girls to understand this one.Anyway, the New Amazon Ultimate Music is by far the Best Streaming Audio on the market today, SQ, Stations, Playlist etc...P.S I have cancelled Tidal and Pandora, my kids still prefer Spotify but when the Amazon Family option becomes available ( Late 2016) I will cancel them as well.Hope this review is helpful, Thanks"

Then this morning as we tidied the house with the 80s station on, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard came on. Only it was definitely NOT Def Leppard. I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard.

Add to that I added 500 songs to my prime playlist.. It repeats the same 20 songs, I don't even hear some artists I've added.Then came the ""stations"" these in theory are great, Pandora killer I thought.. But holy crap are the stations HORRIBLE. lets try punk rock. I hear the same 13-18 songs repeated. Half of which aren't really in the genre. Lets switch to the stations titled ""Van Halen"" One van halen song, then you'd expect a high energy classic rock song, nope.. Lets toss on something a lot slower by abba, stevie knicks or Fleetwood mac. Yeah, they're in the same class.Long song? No problem.. We'll cut it off before it ends...Add to that the app likes to stop playing, then start again, then stop again.. When writing this review I turned on the van halen station, connected to 4G, it would play one song and stop. Connected to work wifi, still played one song and stopped.

(All of my digital music from Amazon is either Prime or purchased.)I have installed Amazon Music on all my Android devices except for, ironically, my Kindle Fire HD7 – which has all of the Amazon Music features already “baked” in to its software.  I find the Amazon Music app very useful for my purposes, especially now that its interface has been redesigned. I can sort my downloaded music almost any way I wish – by genre, song, album, artist, whether it’s Prime music or music I’ve purchased.I also have Amazon Music for PC, so whenever I purchase an album or song, it automatically downloads to whatever device I happen to use to make my purchase. Amazon Music for PC will synchronize itself with my Android devices, so I can very quickly see my new music on my smartphone and tablets almost as quickly as it appears on my laptop.Amazon Music also serves as a music player on my devices. It does a very good job of sound reproduction, although it’s perhaps not quite in the same league with some other of the more full-featured (and expensive) music players.I am very pleased with the Amazon Music app. It serves my purposes well, even though I don’t subscribe to Amazon’s music “service.” Highly recommended."
"11831","Amazon","Every mans music.","Gloria Lombardi","January 23, 2017",5,"The best of music to your liking.  Always has what you're looking for and always delivers great pleasure to hear what you choose to listen too.Because I have Prime, I get to pick so many songs without having to buy it, so my choices are endless. This was a genius development of great minds that got together to create something all and everyone could enjoy. It must have taken more than one mind, but if it was one man, wow!"
"11832","Amazon","Don't download! Caches streamed music on INTERNAL storage only!","Jon","December 6, 2014",1,"Let me choose where the app caches music.  I was getting Disk Full errors on my phone when I realized it's been storing the music I play in a cache on my INTERNAL STORAGE.  When I looked to see if I could change the location, that option didn't exist.I had to plug the phone into a Windows machine and use Explorer to clear out the cached music.  1.8GB of cached files!  Amazon, you can do better than that.  Give us the option to set the cache location or give up on the cloud streaming business because this WILL NOT WORK."
"11833","Amazon","Why can't I organize my music like other music apps???","Karen G","February 28, 2015",1,"This does not meet my expectations.  I expect an app like this to allow me to organize my music and it does not.  In some cases I have to scroll thru all my albums one-by-one to find what I'm looking for.  Now if I want to pull up albums by genre I 'm out of luck.  It appears that in many cases Amazon randomly selects a genre that is not ever close.  If I want to listen to classic rock I can pull up by artist which is in reality the performer.  If I want to listen to classical I am again out of luck.  This app does not let you pull up by composer.  Clearly Amazon does not want classical listeners using this app.  I can try a search but that only helps if the composer's name is in the title.  I have tried creating playlists, not to listen to but to categorize my albums.  Once I pull up the playlist and decide what I want to listen to.  I then go look up the name of the album and pull it that way.This is all such a shame because my Kindle for PC allows me to create all the categories I want and to beautifully organize all my books.  Why can't this app? Who was the programmer on this? Clearly they were one of the few programmers on this planet that doesn't have a musical background.  Another solution would be to use one of the external music apps like Tag Scanner which is the ultimate in organizing your music and plays it too.  However all those prime albums you listen to, you would have to go buy so you can download them to your PC so an external app could play them.Amazon could easily reduce their customer's frustration by allowing us to categorize our albums like we can our Kindle books.  The code wouldn't be that difficult.  Just hi-jack some of the code from Kindle for PC and perform a little neurosurgery on Amazon Music.and you're good.  My dogs are unemployed and they are pretty good coders.  They'd be willing."
"11834","Amazon","Great program with awesome potential but falls short with unacceptable lack of key features and no fixes for years...","Stella","July 17, 2015",3,"I wanted to chime in on Amazon Prime Music. I have been using this service for about a year and a half now. I absolutely love the easy access to my music collection whether I am on the internet at work, out in the world with my phone, chilling with my tablet, or enjoying music through the home surround sound Prime Music is ready to go and streams well!However! I am a serious music collector and I adore having my collection labeled correctly, correct album art, and organised by year of release. Not too much to ask, these are STANDARD music program features since the first Windows Media Player and iTunes....Well you can not change your album art in Amazon Prime Music! In the year 2015 and after years of complaints in the forums you still cannot do this. Yes, there are bogus work arounds like finding the artwork cache on your PC and pasting new arrowroot in there with the same file name as the bad artwork. However this only affects your PC amazon music player, it does not change on your tablet, phone, website etc. Then there is the method of downloading your album back to your PC, adding it to a better music player, using that music players artwork change feature, and then import it back to Amazon Prime Music which may or may not take it or just paste the wrong artwork on it again! Either way this is ridiculous and for a serious music collection this will take YEARS to correct my collection to my standards. So yeah, this is a MAJOR issue for me that really bugs me. Albums will have the wrong artwork, sometimes 3 albums in a row have the same wrong artwork, and many just don't have artwork at all.You also are very limited in how you can view your music, no option for sorting or display release years which is another big issue for me. The program also displays your music very literally by artist instead of album artist. What does this mean? Well instead of displaying lets say all of Beyonce's music under one artist heading of Beyonce, Amazon will have 30+ Beyonce artists, one for every Feat she has ever done. The only way to condense this is to change the artist to Beyonce and lose the information on who she is singing with. This is soooooo frustrating!!When it really comes down to it if i had a better option i would absolutely ditch Prime Music because it is just far too simplistic and limited for my tastes but when you already have a Prime account the price is just too sweet to ignore along with Amazon's fantastic storage limit and bonus features etc. and like i said before, having all your music everywhere and anywhere is pretty awesome! Overall i do like the service but there are just unacceptable issues that frustrate on a daily basis and after over 3 years of this program existing im just left scratching my head at how a giant like Amazon does not fix these issues.... I want to love it Amazon! And it is so easy to fix it so just do it already! I will only hang on so much longer that's for sure!"
"11835","Amazon","Good app and service, weird pricing","C. McDonnell","April 16, 2017",3,"I've been a Prime member off and on over the years but I have issues with having to purchase a membership to be able to have access to the streaming video services and music.  There is nothing special about Amazon music unlimited  that would make me want to pay an additional $7.99 fee to get what used to be included with Prime at no additional charge.  As far as the music app, it works okay although the player could be improved by adding a volume control.  I briefly switched from Apple Music and my catalog transferred flawlessly but I maxed out my Cloud storage the first day and can't add anything else without paying an additional $25 a year, another Amazon gotcha.  They are fooling people into thinking they are getting services for free but they are fleecing your pocketbook. Apple Music is not perfect but it has a lot of features I enjoy and the price you are charged is up front with no tricks or gimmicks.  With Amazon Unlimited Music, that Prime membership becomes expensive.  So, I give 3 stars for the app and 0 stars for the Amazon pricing structure."

Absolute garbage. The music importer worked quite nicely, then the previous iteration of this piece of muck started out ok and you could choose your file locations quite easily. This is just trying so-very-hard to be spotify that it's losing sight of what made it BETTER than spotify. Any searches take 10's of seconds to display anything and then when you click on anything it takes an age to open up, if it bothers at all. This is running on an absolute beast of a PC so the issue is not hardware. Currently this piece of software = WOEFUL."

Very hard to keep musical preferences clear","Stellarr Chance","April 13, 2016",1,"As a Prime member this is a nice way to get music since you have access to hundreds of artists and genre of music.But the app is designed piss poor and is not user friendly at all.First,  the interface is PAINFUL to use. Not only does the app NEVER keeps your music last listened to in check, there is no real way to make a Playlist, keep recently played music in check or even find what you last listened to. Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I  am looking for what I last listened to which is annoying!Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud,  Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear,  even my own music!Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.If you just want to listen to music it OK for that. The app itself is a mediocre music player."

This is on a laptop with an i5 processor, 16GB ram and a solid state hard drive and that is all I use it for.  I don't have any other programs installed on it.  There is absolutely no reason why this program should kill a laptop in order to play or download a song.  I have also noticed that not every song you purchase and download from Amazon is set up to be downloaded through the Amazon Music app, some are still coming down as a zip file.  There needs to be a standard for downloads and then stick with it.  I will stick with Amazon for a little while longer and if it doesn't improve, I am done with it.

When I am done listening to it, there is no way to shut it off without either logging out (so than I have to login the next time rather than just opening the app) or force quit it through application manager.

Also disappointed in this app on Android, it stalls A LOT and requires an app restart or reboot with reload. Streaming is MUCH better on the TuneIn Radio app on FireTV-Android-iOS from many different online radio stations all over the world.  I tried Amazon Music with Prime Music also on Windows 7 and Mac OSX and found it to be inconsistent or get error messages even after installing the latest version of Adobe.On the other hand, Amazon Music with Prime Music seems to work fine on iOS on an iPod.Amazon adding their Amazon Music with Prime Music enticed me to finally get a Prime Membership of my own rather than use a family member's.

Prime does not seem to have the newer albums (Rihanna, Blake Shelton just as two examples). Prime also does not have a very good variety of music to choose from (less popular artists that I CAN find on spotify). I was able to make playlists which was nice but when I play the playlists it stops after every couple of songs (receiving notifications does not make a difference in the playlist, it just stops playing randomly) but then other times it plays all the way through...I would say this is the biggest frustration. Also, it is slow at downloading. When I had rhapsody it was lightening fast, almost so much so I would lose track of where I was! If you download a few different songs at at time it takes a while to do and you can't search for other songs in the meantime.

Prime movies, however, has such a small offering I ususally just skip those as I don't want even accidentally trapped into further pricing.  We own our own movies, plus have Netflix and Grandma goes to the movies with the grandkids so we are cool with amazon on the movie part.

I often pass over songs that have a very limited sample of a song that I might otherwise buy. 30 seconds will give you an intro, or part of a verse, or perhaps part of a chorus or instrumental.

However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent.  The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms.  Play queue being an example.  The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling.  I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist.  Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums.  This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application.  This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application.  This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks.  The ability to thumbs up / down  or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms.  If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow.  It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing.  This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to...  Show me similar artist, records, songs.  Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10.  Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature.  However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11.  Android Screen controls.  The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android.  There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).Overall the service is adequate.  There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market.  I signed my family up for a year.  They all hate it!  We will give the service a fair shake over the year.  If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again.  I expected better from Amazon.  Okay is not good enough."

Of course, I downloaded my most played songs to avoid needing an internet connection every time I want to listen to music which means the app is basically useless to me. I CAN still play songs that aren't downloaded to my phone UNLESS they were previously downloaded. That's right, even if I remove the song from my library, trying to play it still causes the app to crash.UpdateThe app is now fully functional and allows me to play downloaded music as well as stream audio. The redesign isn't as easy to navigate as in previous versions, but it still gets 5 stars because the functionality is there."

I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.Amazon, get it together."
"11872","Amazon","Really Awesome!!!!","Katie A","January 26, 2017",5,"Love Amazon music! It's great for listening to purchased music, and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free (not really free because you pay for a prime membership) but it's a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!! You can download music to play offline without data or wifi (perfect for airplanes). Would recommend this!!!"
"11873","Amazon","My go-to music app!","Leaveamark","October 24, 2012",4,"UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012.  My how times have changed.  The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music.  If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps.  Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012.  Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."
"11874","Amazon","Great quality and selection, poor sorting and searching tools","Lawngahnome","February 20, 2017",3,"First off, the sound quality and selection is fantastic. I would rate that alone at 5/5. If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis, the service is great.BUT, finding music, is a chore. Artists are easy enough to find, but actually getting to an album you want is tricky. The majority of my listening is full albums. From the album selector for a band, there is NO distinguishing between singles, EPs, or full albums, nor is there any note of year (year is visible once the album has been selected, but I've already seen several where the year was blatantly wrong, or listed the year of the re-issue, which is technically correct, but generally misleading). This is a NIGHTMARE for bands with several albums, especially artists who name the album after a title track, release the album, a clean version of the album, a limited edition of the album, the title track as an EP, and again as a single. It's common for me to ""view all"" albums, and it's 3+ indistinguishable links, all with the same album art and name.I've also had technical issues stemming from album selection. For example, from the ""my recommendations"" screen, I can click to an album, and I can add the album to my music, but from the band's page, that album is NOT in their list (specific example below). Furthermore, a band's list of albums is not its own screen, it's a kind of popup, so when I select an album, if it's not the one I want, and I hit back, I am returned to the band's main page. Not their list of albums, forcing me to repeat this cycle.For reference, the album I can listen to, but not find on the band's page is ""The Nexus"" by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there is that ""The Nexus"" is also a single, and there are two entries for said single in the band's album list, and I think one of them should be a link to the full album, but is not."

Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage.  Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music.  I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it.  Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone.  You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected.  You don't need to hog my internal memory.  I guess you are only for top end phone users.  I can't afford you.Listen from the cloud you say?  Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops.  I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what?  It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone.  Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds.  Amazon, I love you.  But I hate your music app."

There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently.  Play button is still activated, but shutting it off and starting it back on doesn't resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen (novel concept). I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."

I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle, Spotify, etc.  The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap.  But, functionally, it it terrible.  I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years, but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired.  Amazon, you can do better with the (almost) unlimited resources that you have.

This latest update, 3.0.2 is the reason I gave it 2 stars.  When you're listening to an album, you used to be able to add another to the ""now playing"" list.  This is no longer an option.  Also, the reaction time when you do something, (Skip a track...play a different album...scan forward in a track...) is significantly delayed.Time for a version rollback :)  I wish.Another ""feature"" I just discovered:  When you add an entire album(s) to a playlist, the stupid application plays the tracks in a random order.  (I don't really know if it's random, I didn't qa test for randomness)  This is mildly annoying for music, pull your hair out annoying for audiobooks."

If only one person on Prime can get free songs and apps, we should be able to designate that member ourselves.I also couldn't download my purchase to my phone without it asking me to change my settings to allow downloads from ""unknown sources"". Who on earth would change settings on their phone to open it up to all? I've yet to log on to my computer to finish downloading it into my Amazon Cloud, and haven't even been able to hear it yet.

"11881","Amazon","I turned blue when the app did... but Amazon listens","Ron","November 8, 2016",3,"I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.CONS0) It's just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I'm uploading or it decides to download something (completely outside of my control) it can not be used.EDIT***Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it's great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the ""see file on computer"" option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.1) On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point2) I CAN'T STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet (yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something..) Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I don't believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they took away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.3) It's now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I don't understand the logic behind taking out.4) When I click ""make a playlist"" from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But  I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.PROSThe color scheme is nicer... the icon looks good?I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now.."

"11883","Amazon","Prime Unlimited Good Value, iPhone App just So So, Echo integration Poor","S. Jones","November 4, 2016",2,"I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think $7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.Now the Cons - easy things to fix:1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though.2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full.  So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it won't try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well:3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it doesn't even shuffle on the command ""Echo Shuffle My Music"" or ""Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account"".  On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say ""shuffle"" again and skip a song. Then it says ""enabling shuffle mode"" and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the $25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.4. Related to #3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time.  If this improves I will update my review."

"11885","Amazon","App works well, the upload process (and programs) is horrendously bad.","Frederick R. Gruner","November 21, 2016",3,"I'm using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I'm looking for.I've got about 30k songs in my collection. I'm trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices (including my echo). The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:1) I've got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbook pro, it shows 110% CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second.2) The underlying threads kindof work (I get lots of ""Cloud Service Not Responding Errors""), you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it's so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click ""got it"" and have the popup dissappear.3) The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it's actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20% of the time (if you're uploading 5 songs at a time). If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever (even hours after it completed uploading the last file). You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service (from what I can tell). If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive."

At least Amazon MP3 was intuitive and relatively usable. The first thing this piece of trash does is hit you over the head with a pop up ad for Amazon Prime. For all the money I spend at Amazon, I don't need the hard sell. You already get most of my money. Until now. Much of my purchased music did not transition from old to new. When I called MP3 customer service, I was advised to re-install the app. After the third time and significant language barriers, I gave up. Amazon sensed a problem when I hung up after being on hold for the 4th time. I received a call back asking if there was a problem. I said no, I was getting established with I-Tunes at the moment. Amazon sent an immediate email giving me a $7.98 credit to be used at their music store. Wow. What's next Amazon? World peace? Fire this non-beta testing software developer, give us a usable app, and I'll come back wagging my tail. Final thought: Amazon, you have impressed me since your name hit the streets.

It is bad enough that I am considering going tomorrow and buying an IPhone and never buying music from Amazon again. Also a better Prime benefit would have been unlimited cloud drive storage for music rather than a million songs that just take up the very limited storage space on my phone or kill the battery if I try to stream it.

I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.This app would be much more useful for me if it would bring back the old upload method.

"11903","Amazon","I love it, but ...","Mike Tarrani","April 26, 2012",2,"UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.Original Review:No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional."

It keeps asking me to start free trial or make a payment. But ive already signed up, and am able to use the kindle book app and the Amazon prime video. So why music isn't recognizing my account I don't know. But I've already called twice about this Amazon prime. It sucks having to constantly call for this stuff."
"11905","Amazon","battery hog","Rickard","September 22, 2015",2,"I hardly ever use this app but keep it on my phone to play music when i buy a new CD while I wait for it to arrive (yes I prefer actual cd's to lossy mp3's).This app is constantly waking the phone to refresh something. It's always towards the top of the list for battery usage even if I haven't touched it all day."
"11906","Amazon","Love the Cloud","Kate Fredericks","December 10, 2012",5,"I have used the ""other"" Mp3 player for years and never liked it. It took up too much room in my devices and is unique to it's own products. I am a freedom loving person and the Cloud player let's me be free. I can buy from many sources and the best part is it doesn't eat up any space on my electronics. The sound quality is superb. Ease of use excellent. When I had a problem today I talked to a specialist in 3 minutes. He took me thru a little tutorial and now I know a lot more than I did before. The streaming has been uninterrupted.It is an easier, friendlier option to the other one and I am very happy to let Amazon store my music until I want to hear it. I have nothing bad to say about it. If you are new to Mp3 music streaming, I recommend, without hesitation, that you start here. II have read the bad reviews and I am sorry to hear people have had trouble with it. My experience has been excellent with all of my devices. Perhaps they have finally worked a lot of the bugs out of it. Anybody who has used Facebook knows about software bugs! Maybe my expectations weren't high. But my experience with Amazon and The Cloud player system overall has been better than most companies I deal with. As I said, I would recommend it to everyone!"
"11907","Amazon","Has its good days and its bad days","Terp Allan","October 14, 2015",3,"It's gone from mediocre to freaking horrible.  I left itunes because they screwed up their program a two years ago.  And recently amazombie followed suit.  It takes twenty minutes for me to access the music and it's molasses if I try to add a new playlist.  It's the freaking cloud connection.  Let me download all the music and you fix the problem.  You can still manage the digital rights and we don't have to wait for your crappy servers to decide to let me access my music.  Most disappointing amazon experience by far.Update May 2017 - They seemed to have streamlined the software code.  Running better.  Still kind of slow but a useable experience."
"11908","Amazon","Needs lots of TLC","Mr.Wrong","February 4, 2016",3,"Received when I signed up for prime I normally use Spotify I like the fact that there is no commercials making a playlist works yet it does not allow you to import the playlist from Spotify. You have got to solve this problem also if I want to sort my playlist for instance alphabetically or when added to the playlist on the app it doesn't allow me to do that I have to manually sort everything. All in all I'm happy with it but you guys have a lot of improvements that you have to make to catch up"
"11909","Amazon","Great idea but still (in 2014) limited","RHagan","November 2, 2014",4,"Great idea but still (in 2014) limited: does not work in Windows phones (no app), tries to show the cover shot of the selection with often hilarious results (minor issue), and limits playlist size, which annoys me because I have classical, jazz and blues in one big file but can separate them in playlists. Loading ""songs"" is tricky (don't like calling a concerto a song), seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references (on a Windows computer), and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files. I still think it is the most economical way to make a cloud protection copy of a large library, having first tried Apple's cloud."
"11910","Amazon","Total garbage","Bryan Prince","August 28, 2016",1,"This app is horrible the interface is clunky and hard to use, for instance the song options in the music library are right under the slidy bar so you scroll down find the song your looking for got to bring up the options and it sends you wizzing off to some other corner of the library because you clicked the scroll bar! Total garbage save your self the frustration and just avoid this whole s***show."

Why would it need wifi for offline music?Music selection is limited and put together poorlyNo information given about music selectionsSuggested music is a jokeI have to constantly uninstall and reinstall PC version of the app because it says it can not connect to internetWorst part is that I am paying for this crap.You have let me down Amazon"
"11912","Amazon","Does this have a point?","bluecircles","May 19, 2016",1,"I have just subscribed to this assuming I can replace Spotify/Napster/Apple Music to stream music with. Maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem to have a great deal of music. When using any of the other apps I've mentioned, I can type in anything that pops into my head, and the chances are pretty high that they'll have it. This thing doesn't even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time? Is this as good as it's going to get?! If this is it, I can't help wondering what its point is."
"11913","Amazon","Really Poor User Experience - come on Amazon you are better than this","Don Schueler","December 24, 2016",2,"Wake up Amazon. You do a lot of great things, this app is not one of them. If you want to compete with Spotify etc. you need to at least meet if not exceed their functionality. Get a good User Experience person to take a hard look versus the competition. Its hard to stop the app from running all the time. There is no simple QUIT option in the menu. It sticks itself in your notifications dropdown but clicking X there does not quit the app. Sometimes it feels like an annoying mosquito app. I love Prime and might consider upgraded music option and cancel spotify, but not with this APP experience. Please get some focus here and fix the User Experience here on this app."
"11914","Amazon","Wont load on Kindle Fire","Hollins","December 18, 2013",1,"I have tons of music on the cloudplayer and cant install cloud player on my Kindle. I have Premium service too. Very disappointed."
"11915","Amazon","Needs an OFF button, too.","Melody L","December 12, 2013",1,"I've only used this app a few times.  The sound is good and it's handy, but each time I've used it when I'm done listening and want to move on, I can't seem to find a way to turn this app OFF!  None of the usual ways seem to work, and the controls only seem to give the option to pause not stop.  Very hard to find a way to close the app.  I've ended up restarting my phone just to get it shut off a couple of times.  So although it's a convenient way to play the music I bought but forgot to download, I probably won't use it anymore."
"11916","Amazon","Marginal app, at best. Step your game up Amazon.","Aaron","July 2, 2015",2,"Searching for songs is near impossible. I'll be searching for music, type the name of the artist and nothing comes up. Type the first few letters of the album name from said artist and the album instantly comes up. Various other flaws in the app but that is by far the most annoying. Love the ad free streaming and audio quality is pretty good when you're actually able to find the music you are searching for. Bottom line, I expect better from Amazon. This has a beta version feel and experience. Their shopping app is fantastic, this music streaming app falls far far short."
"11917","Amazon","I like the variety","Eric Vincent Harris","August 20, 2016",3,"I like the variety, but their analytics suck. I like listening to instrumental music while studying, but I get tired of only classical. So I choose other artists like piano guys, and I do not want to keep saying I do not like the same music on that channel over and over again. I want only instrumental with artists that do instrumental. I had to do a thumbs down 4 times in an hour for Whitney Houston alone on a channel for a composer that only does instrumentals. Please hire someone from Pandora to fix your issue!!!"
"11918","Amazon","I think prime is overrated","Mike2theL","December 6, 2014",4,"The problem with amazon prime instant video and amazon prime music is that amazon removes media out of the clear blue.  One minute your movie and music are there.  The next minute they are gone.  without warning.  At least with netflix, there is a heads up of what movies will be no longer offered as part of their service.  Overall I think the amazon prime service is a ripoff considering what it offers.  The 2 day shipping is great but that part isn't always executed to perfection, especially when it comes to 3rd party sellers (marketplace).  You would have to buy a lot of product to really get your hundred dollars worth.  The media selection part of prime  (music and movies)  is barely good enough."
"11919","Amazon","The only service you need","squeaks327","June 19, 2016",5,"Love Amazon music! Tons of freedom complete albums from all eras and genres. Plus great playlists and singles. As a bonus you can listen from the cloud or your device or desktop. Reasonable pricing if you want to buy instead.  Really no downside. Plus all the benefits of prime video and prime for shopping. It's the only service I need to subscribe to."

They are not in the amazon music file or amazon mp3 file thet must download with the app.  That is all empty.

It has high quality music and I really love that you can even read the lyrics and sing-along with the song of your choice! It's very convenient for me since I don't need to go online and search for the lyrics of the song! My only problem is that sometimes I find it really hard to look for a certain song. Whenever I tried searching for a specific song, it's not the right one. So I have to go and look for the albums one by one. It's a hassle for me. Hope they'll fix this though."
"11922","Amazon","It's gone....","michmom","February 11, 2017",1,"I have been purchasing all of my music on Amazon for the past several years.  I purchase and download all of my music and generally have never streamed it, this was the first time.  I only downloaded this app to my phone because I wanted my daughter to be able to play some select songs in the car.  When I did the download I specifically chose not to start the ""service"" but just to add the app in order to play the music I had purchased, but in the process saw that prime (of which I belong) had some music groupings that might interest me.  We enjoyed playing the music in the car for a short time using the app because I hadn't downloaded the music to my phone.  It took a while before I realized the thing didn't shut off.  Got to work one day went to task manager and closed the app.  Got out of work and realized it was still playing and had been ALL day, and using up my data. Pulled down the drop down menu and there it was, still playing.  Just picked up my phone this morning and realized it has been playing some unknown music all night.................it's gone, going back to hooking up the phone and downloaded my purchased music that only costs me ONCE."
"11923","Amazon","Cumbersome and buggy","C. W. Owen","June 17, 2014",1,"Two primary things about this app.1. It constantly loses your playlist options. Add a couple songs, switch to a new album to add some more and the first ones are gone making it impossible to play songs from more than one album. Same artist loses track as well.2. The UI for the application is one of the most difficult to navigate compared to other music apps. Be prepared to tap through screen after screen to find what you want. Items with a prime discount are not clearly represented and intermixed with everything else, as well as one screen showing you they're $0.00 and another showing the same song as one you have to buy for $1.99. Also be prepared to have 1/2 the songs on an album free to stream but you have to pay full price for the album. Not sure if that's due to an industry deal or not but seems bogus when buying the other half the songs costs less than the cost of the album.I was very excited when I thought I might be able to listen to music on my phone instead of carrying an iPod as well as the phone, but I'm keeping the iPod. Amazon has created just one more mediocre half-baked Amazon product. Very disappointed but not at all surprised."

"11926","Amazon","User interface is impossible","James","December 3, 2016",1,"I *hate* the new user interface.  I use the app on my FireTV with a Logitech Harmony remote (so no voice control - a worthwhile sacrifice to consolidate all remotes).  The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums.  You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library.  I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs.  This interface change has made the music app useless to me, and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place.  I really hope to see this addressed soon."
"11927","Amazon","Finally something that rivals iTunes","Mark Andresen","May 18, 2014",5,"I've finally cut the ties with all Apple devices and no longer have any need for iTunes.  I especially love this app on my Galaxy S4 while driving in my car using blutooth.  The only problem I have is sometimes albums are split into multiple folders.

"11929","Amazon","App does not store MP3s on External SD like other services puts songs in wrong order, splits albums up  & corrupts track names","MDH","March 25, 2014",1,"1.  The Amazon MP# player does not have a setting to store the music off of your internal memory. I travel a lot on business and only downloading 6 albums is not enough. To move your mp3s to an external SD card in your phone takes using ES File Explorer or similar app.2.  The problem is even if you do that the Amazon MP3 app will not find it on the SD card. I ended up trying to use the built in music player on my Samsung Galaxy S4 but wait! the file names are now corrupted. Basically Amazon has chosen to add their gibberish looking item numbers to the front of file names such as B00134NFVG_(disc_1)_02_-_You're_No_Different. This makes it impossible to index on other players. So much for no copy protection take your music anywhere. It has changed to take your music anywhere through Amazon's player, and stream it even though you have to pay your cell carrier extra for the 250mb per 30 minutes it takes to steam music because we won't let you store the music on external storage.3. I have over 11,000 tracks on Amazon Could but only pick and choose a handful to download. When I stream or download the songs the albums show tracks in the wrong order. Try listening to Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon out of order. (There are many albums produces in a certain order & Amazon screws this up - been like this for years. Never fix it)3. I am also having issues with a single album being indexed by Amazon as two to four different albums each with a few songs on them. Click play album {so and so} and it will play 3 or 4 tracks and stop. Pull up the app and you will see where they are split up incorrectly.This app used to be pretty decent but it has gotten much worse over a few years. Now I am going to search for a new alternative whether it is Google, Apple or just manage it on a home server and keep 3rd parties and the music industry out of it."

First of all, this new &#34;Amazon Music with Prime Music&#34; only works on certain devices. The old &#34;Amazon MP3&#34; app worked perfectly all the time. Second, when it works, you get Constant &#34;nag&#34; screens &#34;reminding&#34; you in the most intrusive way possible to try out Amazon's new Prime Music service. These nag screens can be dismissed, but they intermittently continue to pop up. Finally, the newest update won't even open without crashing and it keeps trying to open itself and ends up in a &#34;crash loop&#34;. They should have just left it alone, now I can't listen to any of my music. I guess I'll have to export everything, and start using Google music."
"11931","Amazon","Needs some Lovin' Care!","BC","July 1, 2015",2,"As much as I love Amazon, this app is atrocious. The MP3s that I upload have solid, complete tags with album art embedded and without fail, Amazon Music continues to split albums and ignore my embedded album art. I can understand occasional hiccups with such a vast repository, but this Amazon Music library system is well beyond buggy.If I had to guess, I'd say the app is actually working as intended, but the database and index system that exist in the cloud is so anemic and antiquated, that it can't handle the simple and fundamental functions that I've come to expect from a music library application.Please review and consider an overhaul, Amazon. I love Prime, love my FireTV and love Echo, but this music system doesn't deserve to be included in that list. Sorry."

In addition to causing my phone to choke into freeze mode, the app isn't easy to use. Furthermore, it won't let you put your Amazon-bought music into a folder of your choice to live with your other music. In addition, it heavily favors streaming, which isn't why I *buy* MP3 albums! I want to *have the MP3 on my device* to save on data and play when I have no signal. *Not everyone lives where they have good, constant signal!* This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user-adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using *only * this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non-Amazon music *without choking my phone to death,* maybe I'd use it.

Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda...  undermines the app's quality....IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind....  then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of (downloadable) songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you're from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free w/ pandora, spotify, etc.Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your ""aol.com"" email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device...  its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has (and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices)"

I utilize Alexa in my apartment and the Amazon Music app while mobile with my Pixel XL. I love it! Today I noticed Alexa was integrated with the app. This has been a feature I've desired for awhile now, however, you have to tap the Alexa icon in the Amazon Music app to activate the voice commands. I know it was probably no small feat to integrate Alexa into the app so I'm even considering my three stars a bit harsh. For the sake of experience I'm giving this three stars because of the Alexa integration. Hopefully this critizisam encourages even more innovation. The experience would be even more perfection if when the app was open I could use voice commands with Alexa when my phone was locked or unlocked without having to touch any GUI. It would make my experience with the app even more delightful if I could do that while walking my dogs or jogging. Hands free Alexa while mobile...now that would be amazing! 🙃"

It swallowed up my internal memory and really messed with the phone operation.  So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory.  It's like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it.  They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps.  You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card.  But it doesn't always work.  It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs.  While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure.  I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do.  So one star, because Amazon knows the problems and can't seem to get it right.  Really who can store all their music in Internal Memory.

With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.Amazon, this iteration is complete crap.

"11953","Amazon","Not bad, unless your device has small built-in storage, or you have poor data connection.","!","June 29, 2014",2,"UPDATE:I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this isn't a bad thing. But the problem is when you don't have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can't do anything but force close it.Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.___________I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. It's actually not a bad app, even if you don't have Prime or don't purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that's already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it's much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.I'll also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. It's really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we'd have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card."

If you buy a CD on BandCamp - a much better service if you're buying albums digitally - it asks you what file format you'd like. Amazon Music doesn't; Amazon Music says you'll get .mp3 and you'll like it. Of course, Amazon Music doesn't give you just any .mp3, because they had the forethought to give you your music in 292kbps. That's right, Amazon Music gives you decidedly lower quality music than other services. For a service built around music, Amazon Music should offer at a minimum 320kbps or V0.If you care about quality, I wouldn't bother.

Why do I need to waste time for this useless operation?  Why does it not let me listen to the music while it is ""syncing...""? Why does it not sync in the background?Frankly, the more I use Amazon software the stronger is my belief that it is on par with Microsoft's in terms of confusing UI, marketing-first approach and ""beta"" quality.

As far as maneuvering when using the app, it seems to be extremely sensitive....you can scroll down and all of a sudden what you were working with is gone, or hover over something for a second and you're another spot. My search bar doesn't work, it pulls up nothing, so I've been scrolling to find stuff and I have A LOT of music (see my complaint about scrolling). Much of my downloaded music is missing information and I have to manually fill it in otherwise music isn't where it should be...for instance, I had an album that was downloaded as 12 separate songs because there were no track numbers.  I can't click and drag one album or artist to another area, so anything from, say, Joan Jett is separate from anything filed under Joan Jett & the Blackhearts...I have to manually change the info. Many albums have the wrong album cover art, sometimes even belonging to another artist, and some albums have no art whatsoever....there doesn't seem to be a way to copy an image from the internet, so I can't fill it in manually. The app is visually boring. I liked it so much better when you downloaded and it went straight to Media Player...Media Player is a far better app."

The previous version of the app was very good, allowing me access to my Cloud music and the music store. As it was, I would have given it 4 stars. The reasons for the loss of one star were that 1) You can't store music on an SD card, and 2) You can't sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise, it was a very good music player.However, with the new update, I am of a VERY different opinion. This new update is so full of glitches, it's almost unusable. The correct album art rarely shows, songs take FOREVER to load (even when they're on my device!), I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen times and the song won't change (although the song title text and album art will!). It also runs MUCH slower than the previous version. I'm quite certain it's not my device- I'm using a Galaxy SIII, on which all other apps just fine. I'm giving it two stars because the new layout is very nice, but that doesn't really count for much when the app itself hardly functions.Very disappointed, as releasing something this rough is very un-Amazon-like. They should have done more testing for bugs before releasing. Hopefully they will fix the bugs soon with a new update."

There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone.

And the biggest problem is that there is no SD card support.  Many phones have limited storage, but Amazon doesn't care about us people with older phones.  It makes the app nearly worthless."

Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it.  Well, I'm wrong.  My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no.  Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible.  So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app.  The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud.  Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song.  I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play.  What's the deal with this scam?In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) .  But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else."

This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me.

Honestly the only reason I cared for Prime was the shipping benefits, but when they decided to attach video (again not as good as netflix or hulu)  and music to it and double the price, I cancelled my membership renewal.

Amazon Music says it can handle 250,000 songs, which is great for large libraries, so I uploaded tens of thousands of songs I had ripped and purchased over the years. Every CD I owned, every digital song I purchased, all of them of the last 40 years. This process took forever, but I thought it would be a great way to keep everything organized, and it worked for a while. Now the app does not work if you have more than 40,000 songs, so I am trying to get a local copy of MY music for home listening, and here is where the problem gets RIDICULOUS.In order for me to get a copy of MY music I need to download the Amazon Music app, but the app does not work if you have a library larger than 40,000 songs. So I go to the website, and it is restricted to 200 songs at a time, and there is no stacking. In short it simply does not work for large files. So it will take me about a month to get all the songs, and this is with pretty constant attention. What I find amazing is importing was easy, but 200 songs per download means Amazon is flat out creating a barrier for customers to leave the service, and I find this unacceptable. I spend over $5,000 per month with Amazon and have for several years. I am an Amazon fan to say the least, and this is the first time Amazon has disappointed me in such a large way."

What I love about this app is it also provides access to TONS of Prime music, which is free to those with Prime accounts.  I love the stations and playlists.  I use them when working out or when I'm out for a bike ride.  I select a station or playlist, and I'm on my way.  Amazon selects a very nice collection of music to keep me company.  The stations gear musical selections around the sensibility of the artist chosen.  So the Jimi Hendrix station, for example, plays artists who are in the same general musical family as Hendrix.  Amazon also tosses in a few Hendrix pieces too.  There are hundreds--possibly thousands--of stations and playlists to choose fromMy only criticism relates to getting a feel for how the app works.  It took me a little while to figure out how to access the library on my phone and how to flip between my device music and my cloud music.  Be careful of this!  If you've saved your music to your phone and want to listen to it on your phone, be sure you've selected Device!  If not, it'll go to the cloud to stream.  You'll eat up data doing that.

As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs.  And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley.  The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.But the Android App is now nearly unusable.  It was great before but now is just horrible. I've been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy.  It won't load.  It crashes frequently.  The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality.  The app is also an enormous resource hog.  It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery.  My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all.  I love that it remains ""running"" when it doesn't even work.The desktop program is tolerable.  It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that.  I cannot tolerate the phone app.  If things don't improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership."

Ryan","April 5, 2015",3,"I use this app on my Nexus 7--a Google product--and it doesn't allow me to listen to the Amazon Prime Stations. Not sure this is by spiteful design or simple indifference, but it greatly limits it usefulness to me. IIRC, it wouldn't install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular, further making it of little use.  Works okay on my various PCs, where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora, Spotify, or Slacker. I would have given it only 2 stars except I do like the categorical choices for the stations (when I can see them!)."
"11994","Amazon","Too many permissions, Amazon is just too nosey and invasive.","Fox","March 11, 2015",1,"I never even finished installing this bit of spyware, there's no reason they need access to my browser history or my bookmarks.  I pay enough for prime and my music that Amazon doesn't need to be trying to make money from my private info, too. If they ever trim the list down to the things they actually need, I may try again. But as we all know, big companies don't care at all about our privacy or the fact that we're human beings, not ""consumers"", so that won't happen.  If you love the idea of this company keeping track of every little thing you do, then go ahead and install it! Since I cannot use music purchased through Amazon the way I wish, I really need to rethink where I'm spending my money.  Very disappointed in Amazon as a whole, my privacy matters."
"11995","Amazon","Great MP3 music player","Stanley Fernandes","December 13, 2012",5,"I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily.  It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player.  Easy interface to use and browse your music.My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there isn't one on the original album.  I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music (yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence!) and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause.  Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well.  Try listening to Wagner:""The Ring Without Words"" and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts.  I would give this a 5 star rating if they would fix that problem.UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review.  Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other.  I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended."

Believe it or not this is not the only Windows program or app I use.  Having controls at the top (iTunes), some at the bottom (Amazon), etc. and then have them disappear so I have to hunt for them by moving the mouse around the screen every time I want to pause, or skip, or ...

I love the pre-made playlists. Very easy for an indecisive music fan. Just pick what type of music I'm in the mood for, or a band I like, and Amazon does the rest. I stream this in the car, in the office, and in the gym. Tons of free music available through prime. No complaints from me. I've tried  Milk music, Pandora, and other similar apps. I like Amazon music the best."

Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage."
"12003","Amazon","No ability to save to external SD card","J. Duesterhoeft","February 14, 2013",2,"I hate to downrate the app to two stars.  Overall, the app is a nice player.  Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music.  The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone.  At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars."
"12004","Amazon","Effectively nonfunctional","RayCam","April 9, 2017",1,"Prior versions of this app were uninspired but functional. The current version is so poorly designed as to be nonfunctional.

Near as I can make out, the net effect of this app - if not the strategic intent - to make using this app to access downloaded and owned music so inconvenient that you just go to Amazon Unlimited streaming instead."

The albums and playlists that are free have the prime banner on them and show the price as $0.00. I mention this because you want to be careful as the app sneaks in some suggested albums that cost money. Customers can listen to music ad free!!!!

"12007","Amazon","Amazon Music is Terrible","Stephen Halpin","November 23, 2016",1,"It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music.  If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole.  You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album.  Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time.  It requires you to do that song by song.  Terrible.  I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music."

Sometimes deletes lyrics from various songs (not really relevant since the Amazon Music Player doesn't display lyrics, unless that feature is enabled and then you're left with songs without lyrics)Amazon refuses to play most of my songs that were uploaded to the cloud. These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!"
"12009","Amazon","and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be","John Werner","October 19, 2015",3,"As far as the apps for Prime Music, the latest Windows version, latest Android/Chrome versions, and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be.  There is no music enhancement such as any kind of editor or EQ. I'd like to see a sophisticated sound normalization and EQ option if possible.  The Prime Music uploading app (admittedly a separate app that goes with this one and should actually be rolled into this one)  does seem in immediate need of a major refresh as it seems long-winded and clunky to use.  It should be much more user-friendly plainly speaking.  As for the Prime Music Service itself, well because it's free as a Prime member I'm happy for anything that adds value that I'd actually use and benefit from.  That said, Prime Music has a long way to go to be an actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for.  Yep, if you're paying your going to want Spotify, Tidal, or Pandora.  With these services you don't request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band ""re-recording"" the song which even if you were four or five cocktails in would sound ridiculous compared to the real song.  This is a real serious fault of Prime Music and I'm shocked it's even within acceptable legal limits, i.e. the song says it's ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger but it sounds like an attempt (and often a poor one) to sound like Badfinger...So, how can these songs be represented as THE song by THE band???  Here's the bottom line:  If Amazon Prime Music is going to be anything other than a free music service (which Amazon hopes keeps Prime customers re-upping due to value)  Amazon is going to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the ""bait and switch"" SOUNDS BAD RE-RECORDINGS.  And speaking of sound, the fidelity of actual sources are sometimes noticeably not the best (it's likely the source and not the streaming quality itself), I think Amazon needs to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too.I've been critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free songs in the cloud.  They can be ones Amazon offers as part of Prime as well as my purchases and uploads.  This is the best part and I like it.  If Amazon will put some of it's muscle and money behind this service it will be not only for current Prime members but will bring an avalanche of new Prime customers."

That excitement didn't last long. Takes SO long just to navigate through music. Search is slow and then if you do find the artist/song you're looking for it displays the album art next to it, NOT the one you selected. Beyond that, takes FOREVER just to play a song. Mostly takes up CPU and spins. I've got a super fast internet connection too, so that's not it.Sadly I had to go back to the browser just to play my library, and that user interface is even more clunky. And JUST FINDING MY MUSIC LIBRARY was nearly impossible. Easy to find Prime video, prime music, but SO HARD to find my own music I own.If performance for this app ever did get fixed, it sure would be cool to have an Android app to access and play my library like a remote control. Ever cooler to have an iTunes-like visualizer."

I thought that suddenly my the battery on my phone must be weakening. It is not.In order to download the music that belongs to you or use the player services it provides, you have to allow it to get on your phone's internet . It refuses to use wifi. This is bizarre, but what the hey. I downloaded my purchases and thought everything was fine. Come to find out, I'd used 1GB of data that I didn't even know about. Now, what is that? Then I got busy and forgot to look into it. I haven't used the player in the last week, and now my phone service is notifying me that I've used ANOTHER 1 GB of data!?! What in the world is it doing to use that much. Lucky for me I have a big plan, or I'd be paying now.Amazing. Update: I logged out to stop it (there is no off button and you can't get it to leave your notifications or stand down otherwise), and now it's got a pop up asking me to log in that you can't get out of by pressing the back button.

I have 1 account I use for apps and a different account I use with a  prime membership. All worked well for me prior to single sign on. When Amazon introduced single sign on, instead of making things easier they made everything more complicated and broke things in the process! Initial, after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon, do us all a favor, get rid of your broken implementation of &#34;single sign on&#34; please!!!"

I've been using it for about 6 months and it's finally starting to become a viable replacement for Spotify and Pandora and whatnot. It doesn't have quite the music selection as its competitors, but it has enough to keep me happy.At first there were some design flaws that made things a bit confusing, but they've been constantly making small adjustments that have made the whole experience very simple to use.Also, I'm really happy they've been adding more classic Prog Rock, like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Yes and some of the newer stuff like Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, The Mars Volta.  Can't wait to see more of that and other Prog Rock.The selection keeps getting better every week.One thing I'd really like to see is a higher bit rate option.  I think it'd be a really nice feature, although the music does sound pretty decent as is.Also gapless playback, if possible. With alot of prog, songs weren't designed to have a pause between songs; they just keep playing."

Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages (a couple of screens long).This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really doesn't want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I don't want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this....

I finally discovered that pushing the back ""button"" twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.  This is not how an app which is supposed to stream music I pay for (either by purchasing it or by subscribing to prime) is supposed to behave.  I really wish there was an alternative app."

"12051","Amazon","Mediocre interface, frustrating glitches, and limited library","Forum","July 5, 2015",2,"The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I don’t need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. You’d think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players don’t seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression."

So every time I'm done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name."

"12072","Amazon","Best Place To Buy Digital Music","MnM","June 11, 2015",4,"Prime music is the best place to purchase digital music.  Unlike iTunes which only makes purchases available to my iTunes library, Prime will place downloads in both my iTunes and Windows Media Player libraries.  We've found that prices for digital music is better, on average, than iTunes too -- at least on my PC.  If they could figure out a way to put downloaded purchased music in my iTunes library on my iOS devices that would make it even better.  But for now I'll just have to live with syncing my devices with my PC.I also wish the selection of streaming music on Amazon was better.  This is one place where iTunes and their radio service has Amazon beat.One thing that makes Amazon and their Prime Music service stand out from the rest is when we get free digital copies added to our prime library when we purchase CDs on Amazon.  Now I don't have to wait for the CD to arrive and rip it to get it on my portable devices.  Sometimes you can find albums for sale at a cheaper price on CD than if you buy the download only version.I also like the streaming Prime music library.  It's like listening to the radio and we can eventually purchase the songs we like so they can be played offline or after they are removed.  I suppose this will be treated like the Prime Instant Video service where tunes that were once included with our Prime membership will suddenly become purchase only.  If I could count on my favorite songs being available later it would make me less likely to think twice before renewing my Prime membership."

We have high-speed network access at home but tried also from the office to see if we had a different experience.  Nope!When calling in for customer support I was told to set all Streaming Cache and Audio Quality to minimum.  Guess what...

Over the past few years, it's only grown progressively worse.  It's like a schizophrenic mishmash with poor organization, and as counter-intuitive as possible.I've always bought my digital music on Amazon, but between this extremely poorly thought out app, and the fact that one has to be very careful wading through multiple ""tribute"" band titles when shopping for any music to find the music you actually want rather than ""tribute"" band crap...

It seems to have removed the ""lock screen"" controls, which was really the reason I used this app.  Looks like I'll be migrating over to another music player, which is a shame as I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem and that's where I was getting most of my music.  I'm totally regretting downloading this update and am considering looking online to see if anyone has the old version so I can go back.  PLEASE AMAZON, FIX THIS!UPDATE 12-12-13: There was an update that fixed a few minor issues but still did not bring back the lock screen controls.  And now, when using the Amazon mp3 app, some of my songs cut off half-way through for no reason.  Really frustrating.  I've now migrated over to GoneMAD Music Player.  It seems to burn through my battery faster than the old (working) version of Amazon mp3, but at least it has lock screen controls which is really helpful when listening at work and I have to pause music when I get a call.  It makes me both sad and angry when developers try and tinker with a perfectly good app and render it almost useless.  Let's be honest here...this app really was a gateway for Amazon to get us to use their Cloud Player and buy music through their service.  And I understand that and was OK with it.  I'll use your store...just give me an app that has some halfway decent features and works and we're good.  You had that, but now the app is bunk.  Just maddening.

My #1 complaint is that the Amazon developers of this app are LAZY. They assume that certain devices do not have Google Services installed, instead of actually detecting if they are installed. So despite the fact the app works fine on my phone, I get around 8 to 10 ""notifications"" every day on my phone telling me the app is not supported on my device because it doesn't support Google Services. Really? Then why did I recently get an Update from Google to my Google Services? Duh! My Google Maps and Google Play related apps wouldn't work if I didn't have them.

IMO, this is the one big thing that Prime was missing and now, membership is completely worth it with this feature. I am a HUGE music fanatic on the Amazon Student Prime trial and this has been the highlight of it. Since they recently added the ability to stream whatever I want AND add it to my library, I am ecstatic! I thought there had to be a catch, but lo and behold, I clicked the songs I wanted and saved them to my offline library. I'm excited because I do not have to worry about any viruses on my phone, etc, because all of these albums and songs are found in the Prime library and they have EVERYTHING, and I mean, EVERYTHING. They have 3 seasons of Victorious soundtracks, 150 songs by Veggietales and of course, music everyone actually listens to (Top 40, EDM and even some Indie Rock).The best thing is most of it is completely free and it is so easy to use. I think the previous reviews were outdated because it is extremely user friendly. Just make sure you check if the songs are free or not, there is an option to search only Prime eligible so that rules out any costs. But like I said, the majority are free and you'd expect them to be like 1-star freebies, but nope, you have the Pharell, Vance Joy and Meghan Trainor album available.My only qualm is that the ""genres"" aren't exactly accurate. They definitely need to make an Indie category instead of classifying MGMT as EDM lol and they classified Sara Bareilles as Rock. Ha. But not enough for me to take away a star. I am a highly satisfied customer! Haven't had any problems besides when I download a few too many albums at a time, then it crashes once in a while, but I see that more as my problem and impatience for downloading so much, than the app. I wondered how this would benefit them at all but I realized a lot of people would probably be more willing to stick with their Prime memberships (I probably will) and some of the songs that are able to purchase make you WANT to purchase them because everything else is free.**Again, keep in mind this is written in the perspective of someone who currently has an Amazon Prime Membership, which has made it completely worth it! I have never used it otherwise, this is just based on the update. Thanks :)"

There are three primary problems I've been having with this app on my HTC One M8:1.  The repeat feature for individual songs is straight up broken.  Songs will often repeat with no audio, but continue to stream.  Makes this feature worthless, I got to go find the song in my cache folder and play it with another app.2.  Uploading an album is terrible, since Amazon will often treat artists on the album as being in separate albums, resulting in me having multiple albums defined on my cloud, each made up of only the partial album I actually wanted organized.3.  I used to get by this fine by just searching for the name of the album on the search function and playing out the results.  This doesn't seem to work anymore as it ONLY plays whatever song I select off the results window, despite there being multiple results.  This app is currently doing its best to dissuade me from playing songs by album.I'm not normally finicky about stuff, but for some reason the mobile market really struggles with basic music player functionality.  This app really highlights the problems in this market."

I don't care if my music downloads to my device, I can move that to my SD, no problem. However, now if I want to pause my music while I'm driving, I have to look at my phone, and I don't like doing that. I've switched back to the pre-installed player and unless Amazon puts this function back into their app, the 1 star rating will remain and I'll continue to use the pre-installed player while Amazon MP3 stays in uninstalled useless app purgatory."

I can't afford to burn through my data, streaming music. Last (again going back to marshmallow update), make sure your app is compatible w/the newest upgrade. Since marshmallow I can't update your app. I keep getting the 505 error code even after clearing the cache & data from both Prime & Google Play Store.

Also, I used to enjoy being able to swipe my finger from right to left to go to the next song, but you've ruined that too by causing a dialog box to come up every time you touch the album art. I've cancelled my yearly cloud subscription and will be looking elsewhere to enjoy my music. You've destroyed a perfectly good app in what appears to be an attempt to make more money.

The latter has a near top-of-the-line processor (still), 2gb of RAM, and over 96gb of memory (over 50gb always free). However, on both devices, the program hogs so much resources it often freezes and stalls when on Prime Stations - the main use I have for it. No matter how many background resources I free up, how high a priority I give this app to run on my systems, it has these problems on Prime Stations. Oh, and my internet is a 17mb/s system, so no lack of resources there either: I'd hate to try this on a 3 or 4g hookup. All too often, after a genre-station plays the first song/piece, the second buffers and *looks* like it's playing. But, the resources are so clogged that the *sound* is missing. Then when you try any of the controls to change songs or stations or genre, the app is non-responsive. And, shutting the app down won't free up your system, even force-closing it in the device's settings won't do it: you have to shut down and restart. Until Amazon programmers get this app in line with other music apps and reduces the resource grab, I wouldn't waste the effort using this. The *only* possible use for it is to preview singular songs/pieces (as long as they're free to Prime-members) to see if your interested enough in getting it somewhere you can add it to your collection in an app that runs better."

Without this ability, the App is pretty much worthless for those who stream music to a remote stereo via wifi.On edit: Apple might be most to blame for not allowing streaming to multiple locations. If one option/clicks the speaker icon in the bar at the top of the finder screen, you do have the choice to pick a streaming location. Unfortunately, you can only choose one location at a time, so if you want to listen to music from your computer as well as remotely, you're out of luck.

I can't tell the difference between my music, music I've downloaded (but not paid for) and I have no idea if I'm streaming music or playing it off my phone. There's a cloud library and an offline library, but they seem to contain the same thing.I never really cared too much about this (whether I was streaming or playing my music ""offline"") until I started using the app again recently and noticed I was using a lot of data on my phone. I started clearing my statistics on my phone to see how much the Amazon Music app was using. On my trip to work, which is about 10 mins, if I listen to Amazon music, it uses about 25 - 45MB. By contrast, I fired up Pandora and for the same 10 mins, it used 2.5MB. That's a HUGE difference!Though the free music is great, and it seems to contain a lot of music I like, it's a data HOG if you're streaming and the interface is poor."

Iinstalled it, and once i figured how to download my favorite albums Iwas in hog heaven, until my tablet suddenly stopped being able to download anything.The idiot app was stashing all downloaded music in device storage, so my puny 16Gb of device storage ws all gone while my 64Gb of SD memory was sitting gloriously empty except for some pictures from the camera and some tunes I'd burned via USB from my PC, which went to sd memory as God intended. This behavior continued despite me moving the app to SD. Happily, bringing up the app's on-device list allowed me to easiy delet about 3Gb of music I didn't really need, so I was able to download a bit more stuff I really DID want with some room left over for apps and whatnot.Since the app cleverly hides the downloads from the outside world, I am unable to transfer the music to a less horrendously unreasonable location. GRRR! Since I spent a very long career as a software developer for a top flight skunk works, poory designed software makes me VERY angry, VERY angry INDEED! If it wasn't for this rabidly user hostile feechur, I'd have cheerfully given this this a 5 rating! I'll be transferring 20 gig or so of tunes from my PC to the SD chip - thank heaven Amazon Music is able to see and use such files.One other small quibble: unlike the PC version, there's no volume control in the app - you have to tweak the system volume.

In my case, my 8GB phone (Moto G LTE) will run out of space quite quickly.Athough my android Android 4.4.3 KitKat shows the move app option, it does not work!I am seriously looking into a different ecosystem which has an app that allows me to store music on the external micro SD (32 GB).

Commercial free music is great, but I want to use the music that I already have.

I get several pages of results, most of which were not in my search parameter.  While I appreciate alternate suggestions I would prefer that they were last and not first.  I hate surfing through sixteen pages of music suggestions to find what I am looking for at the best possible price.2nd, some of the sample music is of poor quality, sounds like too much treble or like it is in a barrel.  Maybe this is just the websites player but I find that the more expensive the song the better it sounds on the sample player.  It's funny that the same song on five different albums can sound so different.3rd, now that I've spent an hour surfing for 10 songs I have the nightmare of checking out.  Amazon wants to make it so easy to check out (or get my money) that when I click buy they automatically charge the last debit card I used without my permission or without letting me review the card and charges first.  Now I've got a $50.00 service charge from my bank because I didn't have the cash on that card, it wasn't the card I wanted to use.  You can't change the way Amazon stores you payment information.  The only alternative is to go into your account after each transaction and delete your payment method, more time consuming.  And if you want to call Amazon to complain, good luck.  They don't have a phone number on the web site and it is unpublished.  To make it more confusing, when I switch to my account to change my payment method it takes my to Amazon Prime and then I cannot get back to Amazon Music.  The icon for my cart (amazon music cart) is gone.  So I click on the my cart icon and it says my cart is empty.  I finally figured out that I have to scroll through several tabs to get back to Amazon Music.4th Now that I've made my purchase and want to simply download my new music, it's not so simple.  I have to download their app (that I don't want) to get my music.  Once downloaded the app requires a short coarse on how to use it.  If you want to download your music to Windows Media Player then not so hard.  But if you want to copy it to your device then it's a multi step process.  The download app doesn't ask where I want my music saved nor does it tell me where it saved it.

"12131","Amazon","Amazon Prime Music streaming service has improved","bc","April 14, 2015",4,"Update: Apr 28, 2015:  My review went from 2 stars to 4 because with the latest feature additions.  They added stations.  Pick a genre and play music.  No stupid play list.  The android app still lacks artist search in the station area.I have tried to like Amazon Prime Music streaming service.  This is my second time since its original release.  But it just lacks common sense features that other streaming services provide.Pro: One very nice feature that stands out above the others is Amazon’s x-ray.  Lyrics display during a song.Con: Amazon Prime is hard to use.  Everything is centered on either an Artist or a Play-List.  Where others like Pandora, Spotify, and etc have something called a Station.  A station is similar genre music.Search for an Artist in Amazon, you get a list of Singles and Albums for that Artist.  Now what?  Play one song and search again?  I personally never want to listen to more than one song of a given Artist.  I want Random.You can make your own Play Lists.  But that is just too completed to listen to random music of a genre.  You can select a preexisting Play List.  There are some nice preexisting lists.  But after x songs are done, and then you have to select another list.Pandora is still the simplest to use."
"12132","Amazon","Dodgy","Phil (San Diego)","December 27, 2014",3,"If you use both PC and Android devices to stream music from your Amazon cloud, this Android app's limitation of 500 songs per playlist risks truncating large playlists that you have created in the more usable web interface. Twice in the past month or so my playlists have been truncated to this app's limit of 500 songs. I believe this may happen if you have the same playlist open - not even playing, just open - in the Android interface and in a PC interface. It's happened when I've had the web interface up, and it's happened when I had the Amazon Music desktop app up.The most recent update to this app seems to be crashing a lot, with different error codes each time. Exception 94, Exception 182. The newest version no longer displays song length, so if you have the single version, the album version, and the extended version, there's no telling how much time remains til the next track; the best you can do is re-edit the mp3 ""title"" tags on every song for which you have multiple versions.All Amazon Music interfaces - web, desktop, mobile - are exceptionally weak at library management. Updates and improvements are driven by populist demand, ensuring that app development will proceed as an ever-reducing concentric circle for a single constituency - those for whom the greatest feature add is ""pictures of stuff"". Although Amazon sells its Premium Cloud service with the promise that you can upload as many as 250,000 songs in addition to your Amazon mp3 purchases, the functionality reveals that Amazon's target audience resembles the kid on the bicycle on the web login page; a small collection of mp3s organized into playlists about as long as an album, or maybe even a box set.This is the Android app I use the most, more than the rest of the smartphone put together; I didn't really want a phone, I wanted an mp3 player. The unreliability of the Amazon Music app is disappointing. Life was better when Amazon didn't use this app to push its subscription streaming service. Sooner or later a developer will create a library management app that will be able to stream playlists from your Amazon cloud. I look forward to such alternatives."

However I have never really liked how this app works.Now we have the addition of Prime Music! Huzzah, the selection of songs is actually pretty nice, sadly you have to listen to it through this player. Which would be ok, but it is not like you can have it build dynamic playlists for you based on your musical preferences, also no function for rating music( not sure why Amazon does not easily provide this in their apps as this would seem obvious). I have been toying with Spotify considering if I want to spend my money on it or not, or maybe Google's streaming service. Amazon's players lack of features and usability does not do well to recommend their prime service. Luckily for them 2 day shipping is always what it is.Also the inability for 2 people to listen to Prime music at the same time is lame.*Update*The service is steadily improving, Would like to see the stations get added to the app as this would resolve an issue with it I have had for awhile.

Now since the update, it apparently won't read from the SD card (my other players still do, so I know they're there) and there is no way to direct it to look in specific locations.I will not upload my entire collection to stream as that would be a waste of data and the limitations on Amazon MP3 make that a non-option anyway. I like purchasing music on the app as the prices are usually better than the alternatives, but until they fix the app back to the way it was, I'll be downloading them to my computer, then transferring to my phone to use with a different app.Oh, the new interface blows as well."

First of all, I was super disappointed that ""free music"" really meant ""some free music"". The promotions and even the website make it seem like Prime members have access to full library for free. But then you start searching for songs and see all these price tags. It's super confusing until you realize you only have access to an oddball conglomeration of tunes. Their categories are horrible. I mean, when I see Pop as a category I think it's going to be today's pop music - not Pop songs from decades past. There's no ""today's hits"" section, top 40, or anything like that. And don't get me started on the weird music collections they've assembled. Who are these people who put together playlists? Absolute rubbish. All that aside, if you want to hear some old Journey or AC/DC album in its entirety, you can do that, so there is some value to the service, although if they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear. You could totally survive without this mediocre service."

Lately, songs purchased through the app appear in the app as on the device but not when using the Android Music Player.  I can only play newly purchased songs on the Amazon player which has a habit of locking up the phone when used with my Strava running app.  To unlock the phone I have to pull the battery.

I had to turn it off by putting the screen on the song and clearing the queue, but once I figured that out, it was an okay app.  The new app that includes Prime is much worse.  It will not shut off at all!  I have to go to settings and sign out for it to stop running; therefore, I have to log in every time I want to use this app.  Also the free music is full of tribute bands.  Really Amazon?

Why is it so?  Because when trying to create playlists, I can't read an entire id tag because it's too long.

I would love it if I could first select a genre, then choose from the appropriate stations under that heading. It's just a real pain to scroll endlessly, trying to see what's what.

Editing playlists is a nightmare. There must be some way to reorder songs in a playlist that doesn't take hours, but I can't figure it out. It took me a day to figure out how to not use random order. There's no way to rate individual songs,​ and a song that you have one day can be removed from Amazon Prime the next day.If you are fine with someone else giving you playlists, and don't really want to create your own library and curate your own collection, this is okay.

I am a lover of many different genres of music.  From 70's, Disco, Funk, Orchestra, Burt Bacharach, Easy Listening, Classic Rock, Tons of Christmas, etc. etc.  I previously used Pandora and I ¢¾ Radio.  Those are great apps; however, I found this to be so much better!  I bought the Prime membership at Christmas last year to save simply on shipping.  It was well worth it.  As a whim, I decided to try the music app.  I had no idea how much I would be able to access and download FREE music that I love!  I was quickly creating my own playlist.  I have created quite a library with so many different types of music.  I now listen in my car using my Iphone and listen at home using Kindle Fire HD or Iphone.  I think selecting and purchasing music is quick and easy.  I find all of the process easy.  The only warning is some songs that are free are ""rerecorded"" so watch for that and play samples before purchasing.  Those songs are the minority, but can happen.  If it does, it is easy to delete the song from my cloud or device. I really like creating custom playlist from my library.  It is a wonderful app!I am wondering why so many people have such negative reviews.  I haven't shared their experiences at all.  Perhaps it depends on so many factors such as devices, Wifi strength, etc. etc.  I have had a wonderful experience with it.My only fear is I am building a huge library and wonder if it will fill my device.I love the app!  I think it is well worth joining Prime if you do not already have a membership. I actually opened the app on my birthday as a whim.  Since that day, I feel that Prime is gifting me with more and more music.  I simply search for artist and songs.  Most of the time, there are free offering for most all music I love.  I am thrilled beyond words!Yes, I have purchased some music also.  I have found that many selections I like have a great price on the CD which also includes the MP3 download for free.  So I receive my CD in the mail and have my digital music on devices.  This is a great gift in itself.  I can save the CD as a gift for older family members who do not use digital devices and enjoy the music myself.You will find Prime Music a wonderful tool for listening, collecting, and organizing your music library."

"12162","Amazon","Eats data like it tastes good.","Foster","July 21, 2014",1,"I've been using one version or another of the Amazon Music Player app for the past three or so years.  I've generally been happy with it, found it fairly easy to navigate, and I'm not super tech savvy.  My biggest complaint was the need to change any of the .wma files on my computer to mp3 in order to import them to the cloud library simply because it's a pain in the rear (apparently my files couldn't be matched in the Amazon catalog...odd since some songs from an album would be matched and import while others from the same album wouldn't).  My second biggest complaint was that every time an update would come out, it would change the interface on my phone and I'd have to re-learn where everything was again.  But overall, manageable and fine.Then my phone recently updated to 4.0.4.Which has sucked.  I spent the extra money to import non-Amazon music, greatly expanded my library, and looked forward to the ease of use to which I had become accustomed.  I've found that since updating, my data use dedicated to this app has skyrocketed for no discernible reason.  I'm not a big data consumer.  My average data use over the past year or so doesn't usually exceed 200-250 mb in a month.  I'm on Wi-Fi more often than not (at home and at work, so I'm usually only streaming 3g/4g in the car).  Yesterday, I received an alert from my service provider that I'm close to exceeding my monthly data cap...this app has used over 700 mb of data.In 4 days.When I'm not using the app, I close it.  It restarts itself.  I close it again.  It restarts again.  And it apparently runs in the background ALL THE TIME despite my efforts to turn it off.  Top it off with an obscene amount of buffer time I've never had before, and I'm not just disappointed with the app.  I'm pretty well disgusted with it.  If I'm in my car, I can't fast-forward through a song without minutes worth of dead air because it's still buffering.  It sometimes even happens on Wi-Fi.I've now used my settings so that it will only stream on Wi-Fi.  Which renders it useless for long car trips...a purpose for which I've used it for some time with no prior issues.Given that I paid actual money to be able to use this with more of my personal library, I won't likely abandon it right off the bat.  I'll take the time to find something I like better, transfer my library (again), and move on.  In the meantime, I'm peeved because I need to manage what little data I have left carefully for the rest of the month and trust that this app won't just ignore my settings and keep running itself and eating my data.Sad for an app I've previously enjoyed and recommended to others.  That won't be happening again."

"12164","Amazon","Okay app, but needs some simple improvements","Erik","July 28, 2014",3,"Their latest update makes the app harder to use.  I like the app overall - it easily lets me play music from my device or my cloud.  I really like the Prime Music, and you can even download Prime songs.  It's fairly easy to navigate and use, but I do have some complaints:-The app doesn't rotate with your phone.  When I listen to music at work, I usually have my phone charging, which means the phone is on its side (horizontal) - makes it hard to easily see and scroll through the app when it doesn't rotate with the orientation of the phone.-After the update to this app, it's crashed several times on my Galaxy S5 in the middle of a song...don't know why - just shuts itself down.-On the other hand, the app won't quit when I try to shut it down.  First off, there's no ""sign out"" or ""exit program"" in the main menu.  The only way I can easily find to quit the program is by dropping down my phone's menu of running applications (the quick menu), and there's a little x to close the Amazon Music app.  Only about 10% of the time does this x button work.  Sometimes it'll look like the app closes, but when I turn my phone off, then back on, the app is back on my home screen.  The only true way of completely closing this app and stopping it from running on my phone is by going to my phone's application manager and terminating the process for this app - that's a completely unacceptable means of closing an app, IMHO.-There's no option in Settings that prevents the screen from going to sleep.  Again, when listening to music at work, I like to keep my phone on and see what's playing easily skip through songs and choose what I want to listen to.  Unless I go to my phone settings and turn off the screen sleep option, the phone goes to sleep.  So every time I want to change songs, I have to wake the phone up, unlock it and change songs.-The only way you can see the time position of your song and the length of the song is by tapping the screen.  The time position and length of each song should be shown all the time (or at least give us the option to show it constantly)"

"12172","Amazon","Frustrating, lackluster - I thought Amazon would be a leader for the cloud music experience.","chicvibe","April 4, 2016",1,"This app is incredibly frustrating, and the effectiveness varies by device.  I have it on two rokus, two pc's, my iphone, my ipad, and amazon fire.  1.  I am a super-user, in that I have over 80k songs in my cloud subscription (which says storage is for ""up to 200,000"" - yeah, I know, ""up to"", but it keeps accepting my songs).  I kept getting a message that my (PC version) library couldn't be loaded because it had over 40k songs.  2.  When I try to get in to my library, I get the black computer screen of death that says ""ah fiddlesticks, if you continue to see this message, contact amazon"".  I see that message so often, that I just don't even bother.  My cache is clear, my computer is up-to-date.  Tiresome.  3. Because of problem #1, I thought I would open a SECOND cloud to split my library.  Wellllllll... Now it tells me that my computer can only be associated with ONE cloud account.  This is just my experience with the PC version.  It works well with Roku, except that I do not get prime.  It works okay with the Fire, but the interface with either is somewhat clunky for a large library.  I am phasing out not only using this app, but purchasing digital music from Amazon."
"12173","Amazon","Too cumbersome of an App.","Veronica Gill","April 19, 2017",3,"Takes up too much space in phone storage and uses up too much RaAM, cannot be shut down nor turned off neither. Kept crashing my phone even when it wasn't in use. Only thing good is that some music comes free with the App."
"12174","Amazon","Overall good","sf","August 6, 2015",4,"It's nice to have stations with no ads and unlimited skips. Sometimes it has trouble loading, and sometimes what's on the stations doesn't correspond well to the name. For example, Dire Straits radio plays very little Dire Straits. Overall, though, it's great. I love having offline access to the music from CDs that I bought in the past. That was a pleasant surprise."
"12175","Amazon","Good, but not great","Dan Fethkenher","March 30, 2016",4,"I don't like that if you close the app and come back to it later, it always defaults back to the original screen.

I tried to uninstall (not able to without jeopardizing other apps.  I even tried going into the Amazon App store to download again, with same results.  Very disappointed if this app will not work on my new phone and also just realized it will not work on my 2nd generation Kindle Fire."

I can not figure out how to navigate within the app and I don't want to since there are easier apps to manage such as Pandora. I had a subscription before I discovered Amazon Prime Music and thought that since I am paying for Amazon Prime, why bother with Pandora. Well, the answer is that it is worth the $5/mo. for Pandora since it is so much cheaper  since frustration is very expensive."

I have no idea why Amazon doesn't let me share digital content with my wife the way they do with prime shopping.I would be Amazon all the way for movies, music, audio books, etc if this were true. But I'm not paying another $100 for my own prime account and having all my digital content segregated from my wife's account."

Casey","September 1, 2017",1,"I keep hoping that Amazon will get serious about their music offering but at this point I will not be renewing. The only positive thing is the integration with Echo. In Android, the interface is not user friendly. It's way too many clicks to get to your playlists and the ui is not intuitive. The thing that upsets me the most is their android widget. It's useless and bad never been updated. Other music services have widgets for direct playing of radio stations, playlists, etc. Amazon please play catch up and take this service seriously. I love Amazon but the music service applications are worthless and incredibly frustrating."

I will never own an Amazon Android branded device and attempting to use my Prime membership with my Android devices is the ultimate act in frustration.Amazon, why can’t I sync playlist?.  It was bad enough with previous Android app (playlist would never sync and required downloading whenever change on cloud or vice versa) but NOW no option to sync playlists…REALLY!So, with no hope of ever having android player for my video purchases and Prime membership, less than zero chance or Chromecast support and now the stripping of your measly convenience features for Android, I will not only be cancelling my membership but making it a point to convince family and friends to cancel theirs as well…Disgusting."
"12184","Amazon","Clunky, unintuitive, frustrating","Marcus W. Hambright","August 25, 2015",1,"I tried using it when it first came out and it was so clunky and unintuitive that I've only been using it as a downloader since - and downloading music through this app is an awful experience every single time.  It almost always wants me to re-download and reinstall the app when I buy digital music, and when it reinstalls I often have to restart the app several times for it to recognize that I have purchased music and would please like to download the music.  A while ago, before amazon forced me into using this app to download their music, I used to buy so much more music, but now that the experience is so consistently frustrating, I wait until there are at least a few items for me to buy and I just stopped impulse buying music altogether.  I do like the color orange and think that white text works quite well on an orange background, so the app does have that one good thing going for it, but that's the only good thing I can think of."

The station (NOT one I LOVE, for what it's worth - nice algorithm, guys) immediately started PLAYING! when I did not have my headphones in. NOPE! Do NOT ever autoplay ANYTHING without warning. That was embarrassing and disruptive. SHOW me the station, sure. Do NOT autoplay it.And wow, what ever made you think I would LOVE some Elton John right about now."

This has happened on several songs. I don't know if redownloading will help or not. Song selections could be better. Certain songs you have to pay extra for. You're already paying for music then you search for certain songs and you've gotta pay more.If it was new music I could understand but some songs are 20 years old. There are also a lot of good songs included too. That's why I rated 3 stars.I would've rated 5 stars if slot more songs were included at no extra charge. Another star deducted because of the download issue."

I also wondered who I could call to help me transfer my music from my computer to my S5. Well when I purchased my last CD from Amazon it asked me about using Amazon Music, since I already had Amazon Prime. It did it all for me! Quickly and easily. It loaded all of my purchased CD's and music from Amazon into my new Amazon Music account. Then searched my computer, by request, for my iTunes music. Downloaded the app for Amazon Music to my phone. I checked my phone and it was all there. I can't believe the time I spent without my music on my phone and I could have had it all along! Amazon Prime was the best. But now with Amazon Music it is the greatest. Thank you Amazon!!!"

You can download a TON of music to your device and listen to it without eating up your data. Perfect for when I'm at the gym with no WiFi and still want a great selection.

"12195","Amazon","Prime music has better radio and lists than Spotify","Penano","May 27, 2016",4,"IMO Prime music has better lists than Spotify and radio stations. I haven't experienced a repeated song in the radio stations, and new cool stations are suggested very often using the power of math. That's nice. The only issue is that I think that the library is not as huge as spotify which may be a problem if you look for specific songs very often."

I like having a variety of music and change what I listen to based on what I am feeling at the moment or what I am doing, or need to do. Prime music allows me to an almost unlimited choice of music without having to pay for every single song or album. If you like to listen to different music genres and don't want to pay a bunch of money to have it then give Prime music a try."
"12201","Amazon","Needs a few simple but vital improvements","Stephen C. Innamarato","September 5, 2015",3,"I like the fact that I get to listen to music comercial free with my Prime Membership but the app needs a few vital improvements to get a 5 star rating.  1.) When clicking thumbs down, I wish it gave the option to  permanently exclude the artist from my station.  I don't like Nickleback and I keep pressing thumbs down only to have another Nickleback song play later on.  2.)  When creating Playlists, I wish it the had the capability of slecting songs from your cloud library AND your offline library for the same playlist.  3.) My favorite station  never stays up top and sometimes I have to search for the station I was listening to an hour ago.  Can we ""favorite"" stations and create a list?  4.) When listening to stations, I often will hear the same songs over and over within an hour or two but yet songs I hit the tumbs up for could take days until I hear them again.  That's just baffling!"
"12202","Amazon","quite buggy","Kathryn M.","June 29, 2014",2,"I was looking for a cloud/PC app that would allow me to ditch GooglePlay's music app on my PC and android phone (Samsung Note3 is what I presently have).  GooglePlay will allow you to upload your entire library from your PC, either iTunes, Windows Media player, etc.  Its pretty good, all the songs uploaded and you can create playlists and download those playlists to whatever device you're using.Amazon's does that, pretty much.  However, not all songs uploaded.  I tried rescanning and rescanning, and ever time it finds a few more songs to upload.  One album of mine in particular it absolutely refuses to upload.  Nothing is wrong with the format, or any of the locations I tried moving the songs to in order to try an upload... just tells me there isn't anything new in the folders to upload.  And no, they are not in the amazon library at all with me just missing them.  I checked the entire darn thing.Also, it uploaded quite a few songs multiple times.  Some songs won't play all the way through.  I can't seem to find a way to move an entire playlist to my device instead of just streaming the music using my data that I am limited on.  Since I don't have a wifi connection at work, this is pretty much useless for me.I like that I can use amazon prime music and get a lot of songs free, but since I can't get the app to work on my computer anyway (tried many times, and I'm tech savvy enough to be able to do that kind of thing) Amazon music isn't for me just yet.  Amazon, I hope you can fix these items, you're so close! :)"
"12203","Amazon","Fine if you only get your music from Amazon.","Christopher Kelly","September 14, 2016",3,"This app is solid, but it's working overtime to force my loyalty to Amazon. I get it; they're giving me a free app, that's their call. But the app struggles to find the MP3s that are already on my phone, and the music files I download from Amazon are in a proprietary format that other players can't recognize. Also, I have no control over the location of that music. Overall, it feels like this app is trying to control my experience in a way that other music players don't. If you really only get your music from Amazon Prime, then this is a great option. If you have a large collection of MP3s from multiple sources, then this app is more trouble than it's worth."

Between this and all of the issues I have with prime shipping not actually delivering to my house since they insist on using surepost, I think its time to wean myself off Amazon.

I will preface this by saying I have a Fire TV, And a Fire stick, yet My Roku Stick's app will not let me stream Amazon Prime Music unless I own it. Why is the app features not the same across the board? Amazon has always claimed they didn't make a lot of money on the hardware but it was a way to entice people into joining Amazon Prime. I probably should not be venting on this site but maybe someone will listen. I still like Amazon Prime but there are some chinks in the armor. It will be interesting to see some of the decisions they make in the near future."

Amazons update has lost 500 songs that I can't play.When I contacted Amazon they said clearcache. When that didn't work they said to refresh the cloud.  When that didn't work they said uninstall and reinstall.  Now they want me to call them and troubleshoot the app problem with them.Um excuse me but it id your app that has the problem, not me.

I have also noticed, the sound quality on Amazon music is way better and louder then when I listen in the Apple app. The bottom line: Ditching Apple iTunes like a bad habit, switching everything over to Amazon, and I may even add a cloud subscription so I can upload all of the stuff I have purchased from iTunes over the year to have it in one place. Please, please, keep it good and continue adding more music, and don't feel the need to copy Apple. Apple let its success got to its head and is on the decline, this is a breath of fresh air."

At times it is sluggish.  I can't seem to get it to make a post to my Facebook account to show what I'm listening to (not a huge loss there).  Navigation can be frustrating on a device.  The web interface is a bit better.  Give me an option to see my cloud music and also separate my owned music from my Prime favorites.  That would help me a bit.  Also, how about letting me pick a genre and just start playing songs in random order.  Kinda like a radio.  I'd love to be able to thumb up/down a song in that mix to skip that type of music.** Updated on 11-14-2014The Android app has gotten very good (a new phone also helped).

From just being able to slide down the album cover from the top instead of having to press an arrow from the left top corner(furthest angle to reach when using dominant hand). Why is it that I have to add a song to the cloud in order to make a separate playlist. That very feature will cause accumulation of different music types. Also the lack of music choice feels significantly limited. Change the layout too it's just so boring and unorganized. Also add dates of albums to know what's new and maybe popularity LEVELS of music. There's potential but there a lot to work on. One thing I do like is the lyrics. But please look at your rivals and actually compete.-iPhone 6s user-"

"12222","Amazon","Frustrating because promising","Amazon Customer","September 15, 2011",3,"This app frustrates me far more than any other on my phone (an Atrix).  I uploaded all of my music onto the cloud player in the hope that it would finally unify all of my fragmented music collections; it has done so fairly well on my various computers (though the tagging and ""Unknown Artist"" issues still pose problems), and I love the browser interface.  However, the android app needs a lot of work on the core functionality.  If it worked as it's supposed to it would be spectacular, offering the capability to buy a song from the store, then switch to the cloud player and play it instantly.  It would also free up all the sd card space that music eats up (at least while you can stream it over wifi).  In practice, though, it just doesn't offer the experience it promises.  It force closes about 60% of the time I try to use it.  When I try to scroll through the list of artists on the cloud player it stutters horribly (and usually then force closes).  Music playback often skips.  This last issue may be android's fault, as I've noticed it in other players, though never so badly as in the amazon one.  However, I don't experience the other problems in different music players.  Until Amazon fixes these issues, this app is still just another dumb music locker that allows you to download songs so you can play them with some other application.  It's an exciting idea, and the interface would be excellent if it just worked."

I get to listen ALL of my favorite music. I have found almost every song I have ever loved and added it. You can listen by playlists that you make yourself or pre-made playlists. You can listen by album or artist too. I really love having this. There's always new music that I can listen to and the best part about it is, there isn't any COMMERCIALS or pop up ADVERTISEMENTS! Prime Music is the Best. I can skip a song, I can repeat the song just played, read the lyrics, and either use the thumbs up and they respond with ""we will play more like that,"" or thumbs down. ""we won't play that song again.!"" How perfect is that? I LOVE this app! I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."

I've uploaded all of my music to it - currently just under 16K songs - and I buy all my music from Amazon. So I should really love this app, right? No. First off, with the amount of music I have, I think in terms of genres. I don't think ""I want to hear artist XYZ today"", I think ""I'm in the mood for..."" and pick a genre, then pick an album or artist from that genre. The fact that Amazon doesn't allow me to select music by genre on this app is absolutely baffling. Please Amazon, add this feature. It's PAINFUL not to have it.Secondly, as someone who changes phones often (typically using overseas models) and lives in the USA, it's hugely frustrating that Amazon is so fiercely geographically fixated on only allowing the ""right"" version of this app on your phone, then logging you into Amazon.co.uk where none of your music exists. Yes, I'm an edge case, but come on Amazon - why do you have to cause me so much frustration? Just let me log into my account and let me play my music."

HOWEVER, the last couple months I've been getting warnings about data usage from Verizon.  Every time I look for what's using data, I find that this app player is open and running.  I keep turning it off and it keeps turning the player back on in the background.  After removing the app, reinstalling it and removing it again, I've discovered that it was the reason my battery life is lousy.  Something in this app has started to run in the background, chew through battery and result in data charges.I used to really like this app and listened regularly for quite some time.  It's only the last 2 months that something in this app has been causing an issue.  In back to back testing with the app installed, then uninstalled (not using it at all), I went from having roughly 30% battery left at 5PM versus 70% battery left at 5PM.  Reinstalled the app, was back to 50% battery by noon yesterday, then removed the app.  Today I have 86% battery left at 1:30 PM.  The power figures I quoted are WITHOUT EVEN RUNNING THE APP.  If I used it, I had to recharge my phone before 4PM.  The phone was also always warm with the app installed, which is a sure sign of power usage.I'd say that's pretty definitive.  There is something running in the background that cannot be turned off.  It was eating my battery and eating my data.  It didn't do it until the last couple months, so they've changed something in the app. that's causing the issue.  I removed it from my phone and the phone is back to normal.  I will miss it as I used to use it regularly.  But, I don't like being spied on."

I have emailed to request a complete refund, and will up the rating once this occurs.Note: I attempted to verify the bitrates on the album pages, but I was directed to AmazonMP3's app, which didn't offer any product details.I realize that I am being very OCD here,  but as a huge fan of both Amazon and the Archeophone Archives products,  as a consumer, I want the best quality possible. Give me that at a good price, and I'm very happy to spend all my fun money here :)===I bought 4 mp3 albums for the first time over the past few days, featuring acoustic-era phonograph music.  Given my past experience with Amazon,  I was greatly dissatisfied upon listening to the albums because they're 256kbps and I was expecting,  if not lossless FLAC, then at least full-320kbps.It may not be much of a difference,  but as a fan of this music, I am VERY disappointed on principle alone and would love a refund of these four $8.99 albums.

Then again eating up my high speed data can be somewhat annoying, if not loathsome. To me I see this app as the corporate version of napster. They would love to share their music with you and give it to you in an unlimited amount of empty files and constant commercials selling you something every other second from every direction in the form of music track and albums for sale. As well as other apps and other membership services. Basically it's a rent to own type deal letting you download certain tracks to your device without giving you full access to files and always giving the option to buy.  .... rent it as long as you like you never own anything unless you purchase it. You can't download to other devices aside form the device the app is installed in. The files being only accessible via the app so when your no longer a member there's no longer music it would seem. hmmm... something to think about."

You can select to display the music in the Cloud, previously downloaded to the device, or access the Amazon ""Store"". The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but, as other reviewers have noted, it does not allow you to select where they are stored (i.e. to your SD card). The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I don't have a lot of music files, but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.Recommended!CFH"

Where do you think this app would create its default download directory?  The local device of course. Well, just change the default download directory to the SD card and....oh wait a second, you can't. They don't permit this. So you buy their music and you can't store it on your SD card. Why do people buy SD cards in the first place? So they can store large files like photos, videos, and yes - MUSIC.  Good job Amazon, good job!"

I deleted some songs off my phone and wanted to re-download them, only to find out that the option isn't available because on the app it lists it as already being downloaded. Not only that but the partner program on the computer has to have the most needlessly complicated way of uploading music to your Amazon music library, and that's if it even works. Literally worked fine the day prior, and now the program is barely running, and when it finally does run when I try and drag the songs I wanted to upload into my library, it says no songs were added."

They told me to logon to amazon and delete the music from there and try to re-download.That will actually permanently delete your music and you'll lose it forever.The app has no EQ so you'll have a less enjoyable music experience unless you play through another app."

I also am disappointed in my ""cloud"" albums.  I've bought MANY a CD from Amazon before streaming became the ""thing"" and VERY few albums are actually available to listen to.  I originally thought the idea that my music that I've purchased over the years being available to be all the time without having to load up space on my phone or always carry my iPod around was a great idea, now with such limited choices, I'm no longer impressed.  My other REAL ISSUE with this app is its own incompatibility with Amazon Fire Stick.  Why in the world would amazon make an App that isn't compatible with one of its own devices?"

It's obvious they didn't spend enough time on the service, and its a poor reflection on it's customer-centric brand promise (Or Jeff Bezos needs to rethink who's running Prime Music). I gave three starts only because the music is free, great sound quality, and its a convenient addition to my prime membership.That being said, I am not impressed with the service. It's too difficult to find the music you want and its ridiculous that you have to add prime songs to your library to listen to the full song. I'll give them some credit because the service is fairly new, but COME ON MAN! YOU ARE AMAZON.COM! If you're going to compete with Spotify, Pandora, and soon to be YouTube then compete. I'm giving it a chance, but wont be surprised is I revert back to using the unpaid Spotify service. As a prime member, I demand more & I expect more specially when it comes to music."

I don't enjoy making playlists, and I always opt to use premade or instant playlists. Amazon offers playlists that cater to my tastes, and which include some songs I like that I don't otherwise have in my library. In that respect, I really like what Amazon has brought to the table. That said, I do have a few issues with the app. Streaming on my PC is perfectly fine, but the streaming playback on my Android phone is always choppy at the beginning of each song. My LTE coverage is perfectly good, and Google Play has never had trouble streaming on my phone. My second issue with the app is that it wipes out the active playlist after a few hours of being paused. I want to get out of work and just push play and pick up where I left off. I don't want to have to find that playlist again and figure out where I was. The last issue I have is that the notification tray play button doesn't work for me. This might have to do with the fact that my playback is always paused via unplugging an auxiliary audio cable, but the play button should work regardless. I don't have too much to say about the fullscreen app itself, as I only use it to pick my playlist."

Before you can listen to songs you must ""add"" them to your library which then forces you to go to another screen to listen to them.  What if you just want to listen once?The mobile app doesn't allow you to search by Artist.  SERIOUSLY?They need to drop the shopping cart idea and take a good look at Google music.

That having been said...I use Spotify 90% of the time, and Amazon Prime Music the other 10%, largely only for music Spotify doesn't have.

Now it locks up or it just doesn't play music at all -- it attempts to play, but then skips to the next song.  Real frustrating.  I'm satisfied with the music selection -- I don't expect to have everything, so that's ok.  Love the playlists and the flexibility of arranging them on my PC.  But Amazon really needs to work on this cloud issue.  For the record, each morning, I restart my phone and clear my cache -- my phone is about 85% filled -- so I believe the issue is the Amazon.  They need to get on this or lots of us are going to go to Spotify, Pandora etc.  In addition, I'm also have playback problems watching shows on my TV -- again, I didn't have this problem 6 months ago.

From the moment you start it up you're given two choices/buttons: Cloud Drive Music or Store. Each time you boot it up, you get the same two stupid buttons: Cloud Drive or Store. The ""Store"" is ever present, regardless of where  you may be within the app. What's more, the app continuously crashes hangs on my multiple devices: LG Optimus Slider, Motorola Triumph, and XOOM tablet.

It would be fair if it allowed for a maximum number being the members of a family (ours is 8). Many thanks for an otherwise FANTASTIC service!!!"

In general there is a great selection of music in Prime.One piece of feedback... I can't do much more to interact with the playlists than rate a playlist overall. I listen to the playlists when I'm at work and have been finding that there are times where I'm liking the music so much I want to ""like"" or give some sort of feedback live. I've been using Periscope a lot lately and have been the digging the ability to tap little hearts during the live broadcasts. That would be pretty cool to do when I'm listening to Amazon Prime music and you could get more feedback on how people are liking the jams.Keep up the good stuff!

I then downloaded what seemed to be the same App from Amazon, which came with a credit.  Then came the support merry-go-round.  My first rep was difficult for me to understand, very slow to understand me and didn't seem knowledgeable which was understandable since he was in Africa.  After getting an American rep, I was no more successful.  I have received two, not one email welcoming me to Amazon Music, so I guess I had registered but still no clarity on the error message. i QUIT.

Namely being able to listen to full albums and playlists of individual artists without forced ""variety"". Biggest issue so far- NO UNKNOWN HINSON! Seriously... UNKNOWN HINSON is the KING of Country and Western Troubadors (doubt it? Google it!). How can they even have country music on here and not include the King?! I am sure other artists are missing as well, but it is imperative to include Unknown! Squeaking by on Hank III, even though the edited versions of his songs come up first. It is cool that censored and uncensored versions are available... As a parent, I like that. Battery usage seems comparable to Pandora. No ads (yay)! Just started using this today... So far pretty good. But, seriously- ADD UNKNOWN HINSON! Then this would be great!"

It ran on my Samsung Galaxy in the same manner.  Now I absolutely abhor this app.  Trying to download an album without the 1000 error code is not possible for me.  Now instead of trusting that the entire album has been downloaded I need to double check.  It is not my network connection nor the network.  I run in to these problems at home, work, even when running 4G as the only wireless connection.  I now have a note 3 and these same problems persist.  Not impressed at all.There are other issues with the app such as when the ""red exclamation"" (indicating a download error) icon appears on the ""Song"" line.  Quickly touching this icon should take you to a pop up screen asking if you want to retry or cancel the download.  Half of the time when I hit that button the player opens and tries to play the song.  Very annoying when you are in a meeting and trying to stay awake:)"
"12306","Amazon","Like the service, Android App rather disappointing","Amazon Customer","December 1, 2014",2,"Like the prime service over all, but rather disappointed in not being able to store music on the SD Card. Really have trouble believing that this use case wasn't brought up in the process of developing the android app as storing music and other media on the SD Card is very common.  I can guess that storing stuff on the SD Card (world readable, 777 all that) is likely at odds with whatever deals they struck to 'protect' the music (I'm guessing files are not DRM'd, but rather they are relying on some File System level protection on the internal storage ... kinda mixed feelings there).  All the same, I hope Amazon gets that this model/method won't last, not at least for Android deployments.Also, I find the new 'prime' interface rather complex for what should be a pretty straightforward app. Oft times, I just want to see What's on my phone and make a playlist from that ... and it can be rather difficult."
"12307","Amazon","0 Stars should be an option","Squeaky D","June 2, 2015",1,"It interrupts at intervals of 10 seconds to a couple minutes to load a song, meaning it sometimes takes 10 minutes to play a 3 minute song. This is on a T3 connection at 2:30 p.m. CST, so no peak times or slow connections can explain this away, so the streaming function is worthless. Add that to the fact it is very hard to even find your music and that the user must be very careful to not be tricked into buying songs even though Amazon advertises it as ""Free"" music. I never thought I could dislike a music service more than Pandora... but this takes the poo cake."

In the old days I could access any song in my collection with a tap on the screen and instantly be enjoying my music.Life was so carefree back then. Then one day THE UPDATE came. Now this app is a wasteland, destroyed by code. It might play a song if I tap on it, but most likely it isn't going to. You can try to play other songs but they probably aren't going to play either. And you know those songs you have saved on your SD card... well they might as well not exist anymore if you're stuck using this app. I hate this app with an unhealthy passion. I think it's mostly because I feel like I've been betrayed by something I once loved.I did find a work around to these problems. I bought an ipod classic. It doesn't hold all my music, but it holds a lot, it doesn't need wi-fi and best of all it plays music when I want to listen to it, not when it feels like it.  Next year I'll save 25 bucks by not renewing my Amazon cloud account. So I've got that going for me, which is nice."

But everything works great, no need for Wi-Fi or data access to play anything downloaded to my ext sdcard.

It is often not possible to open up Amazon Music to listen to your (downloaded) music without logging into Amazon (e.g. whenever they have a software update or just want to check up on you). It’s not a stand alone player, so if you are offline and away from an Internet connection, you maybe out of luck.I finally switched to iTunes, which is not set up this way. Apple believes that after you have purchased the music, you do not need their permission to listen to it!"

Not to mention the amount of memory my music takes up. It just frustrates me to no end.

It took me a while to search and find that Amazon has changed/upgraded the app and changed its name.  Thought about downloading the new version....but would it overwrite all of my existing playlists?  LOTS of those to lose.  Also there were references to fees and charges for the new version of the player.  Called customer service and of course got transferred around before getting the information I need.What an unnecessary waste of time.  Instead of sending me an email before the switch, touting the latest features (and more selling opportunities for Amazon),  they made me mad, wasted their customer service agents' time, and BTW, I STILL don't know what the new features are.Useful to know: you cannot export a playlist from this player, or even print one for reference."

Woo hoo...Since becoming an Android user I've been tolerant of ""good enough"" music synchronization capabilities offered by other applications (including the upgrade/pro version of Winamp and doubleTwist. One (Winamp) was good enough, while doubleTwist had serious issues that led me to uninstall and look for other solutions.The turn to Amazon MP3 came when Amazon added its ""AutoRip"" service to user accounts. In short: if you were already using Amazon's cloud player (I was), they added the tracks from any CDs purchased from Amazon (since 1998) to your cloud player list. Since I had already made an ""Amazon over iTunes store"" decsion earlier, this became an ideal solution for me. Essentially, all music I've ever purchased from Amazon is available in cloud streaming and .mp3 formats (and presumably I still have the physical media from CD purchases, which are not so frequent in my house these days).As for the player itself: it quickly indexed the .mp3 contents of my phone and flawlessly accesses my cloud content (network connections permitting). It automatically switches between Bluetooth and headphones, depending on the what I'm playing the music to. The interface is uncluttered and intuitive.

I also liked the fact that Amazon bumps the bps from the 192 max on Apple, to 256.

While this is true, you can easily download the songs onto your device and then add them to your playlist.  Easy peasy!The only thing I wish I could do is to bookmark songs within a playlist.  I would love it if they would add it as it would be really easy.  I like to listen to both .mp3 music files and audiobook files and having a bookmark feature would allow me to switch between music and the spoken word without loosing my place inside of a book.

For some reason this app only lets you download music to your internal memory.What does that mean you ask? Well, Android users have this awesome feature where you can add memory to your phone using a micro SD card. Usually we add these for apps like Amazon Music because music and video can take up a lot of memory. Especially if you're a music lover. For some reason this app doesn't allow you to save music to you SD memory, just your internal, which is usually only 16 gigs or so.If your device has a lot of internal memory then by all means go crazy with this app, it's pretty awesome. But if you have not that much internal memory to spare THEN AVOID THIS APP! IT WILL EAT YOUR MEMORY LIKE THE KLUMP'S AT AN ALL YOU CAN EAT RESTAURANT!Until they fix it then I'll change my rating."

The only issue I have found is that shuffle will play a song which has already been played in the playlist more than once before it plays all the other songs. I wish that it would make sure to play each song first before playing a song again. I'm sure this is something they will fix at some point in the future or at least give you a setting to control it.

It's virtually impossible to browse anything--your own music, Prime content, the built-in store, anything. For one thing, the ""back"" button barely works. For another, the sort and search functions are woefully crude.Imagine everything awful about a piece of software and you have imagined the user experience of this program: pure frustration.Amazon, you really should be ashamed of this one."

I went through amazon support for this and they recommended I uninstall and reinstall the app so I did. Same problem. Amazon Music was using a large % of CPU even ever closing the app. Support told me I needed to force close it. How about coding a quality app that I don't need to force close, Amazon?  For the record I only ever listed to music that was local to my device. Never streamed music."

There is not a lot of choice of music-especially for those who prefer niche artists rather than main stream pop. Even though Amazon basically invented the recommendation algorithm, its music recommendations fall very short from what Deezer providers. I bought Amazon Prime specifically for deliveries of Amazon purchases and have given Amazon Music a chance. But Ive now resubscribed to Deezer."
"12416","Amazon","Duplicate Songs in Amazon Music Playlists","Colleen","June 26, 2017",3,"Its not bad. Good selection of music to pick from. However the biggest problem is duplicate songs. When you click to add a song to your playlist, it doesn't notify you if the song is already there, it just adds it therefore duplicates add up. Spotify would notify you that the song was already added to your playlist. They really need to look into fixing this issue, seems like a simple fix to just prompt you before adding."
"12417","Amazon","Best of the Best","Will W.","August 24, 2011",5,"I am an Amazon MP3 convert. I first learned about the Amazon MP3 store when clicking buy on a song I liked from the slacker radio app.  I have been hooked since. I have an approximately 6 GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay, around 1/3 of them are DRM protected.  While my wife is happy to purchase an iPhone, I would like to listen to my paid music on my computer AND on my Droid.  Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allows me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid, desktop computer, or laptop computer.  All of this for the same price (and often cheaper) as iTunes.I am also a participant in Google Music Beta but have found the Amazon player to be more to my liking. Not only does Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive is a free service.  I did not realize until recently that the storage for music purchased directly from Amazon MP3 is not included in the 2 GB quota that is provided for the free cloud service.I am also suspicious of Google's music beta. Don't get me wrong, I love Google and Google products and they have a track record of providing free services that offer alternatives to current paid services (often at potentially expensive costs to the company while upsetting competitors). However, the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that says ""Free for a limited time ..."" makes me nervous that they are waiting for people to upload their entire music library, become dependent on the service, and then start charging a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth.But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your hearts content without worries about running out of cloud storage space or hidden or future costs. Then enjoy life streaming your music or downloading it to listen offline in areas where your reception is not so great (or if you do not have a unlimited data plan)."

When I try to shuffle that, it blows up the app and force-closes on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  It seems that it cannot handle the shuffle of that many songs.  This is a big bummer and my primary complaint with the app.The other thing that bugs me is that it seems to be missing the ability to add songs to playlists at various parts of the application.  For example - if you're playing a song, you can't add it to a playlist from that point."

The caution I have is that - with large music libraries, up and downloads take significant time - even on very high speed connections (I have Verizon FIOS 50MBS bidirectional and Gigabit WiFi).It is best to clean all your files and ensure correct MP3 tags are in place BEFORE you upload - otherwise, the service automatically modifies tags while upgrading the music file quality.

My phone updated the app, and a massive amount of music was suddenly available for my listening pleasure.  Great in concept!  But, the new version of the app has made playing songs from my device a miserable experience.  Where it worked flawlessly a few days ago, it now takes MINUTES for a song to play.  I give up on it working, put it back in my pocket, and a few minutes later hear the song take off.  Skipping ahead?  Nope.  Pausing?  Yeah, that works well still.

Its also a major power drain listening to music on the cloud... so if you want to listen to it on the train to work understand that your phone will die quickly.  Convenience of being on the cloud vs. an ipod that won't drain your phone battery (and stay charged for much longer.)  I don't see the point?  You could load the music onto your phone.. but many of us have more music that storage on our phones...Playlists:  Welcome back to 1989 when you have to manually figure out and organize your playlists and upload them to the cloud (instead of making a mix CD or tape).  No automatic playlists based on a song you like.  You have to manually add each song to the list to make a playlist.  I use Itunes and MediaMonkey (with some apps installed) to help create auto playlists.  Or I make the playlists manually on one of those programs and then upload them to the cloud.  What a hassle.  There should be some sort of technology that can make auto lists.  Not all auto playlists are good I know but Amazon has nothing but the most basic playlist creator (on the browser-based cloud player).  I keep going back to Google Music because of the ease of making lists and not having to go to Amazon and have to listen to old playlists or entire albums....  I haven't dared try to make a playlist on the app due to it locking up when I scroll through my large library.  I don't know if it's even possible.Uploading songs:  Google has a small program that stays open and looks for new music on your PC and uploads them automatically to the cloud.  Amazon you have to remember to sync your music and playlists.  There is an option to only select a few folders but honestly I end up rescanning my entire Itunes music library to make sure I don't miss anything.  And my hair is quickly going grey every time I forget and close the browser when the compare part of the upload process is going on and you have to start from scratch (yes, it scans your entire library and the library online to figure out what to upload to the cloud prior to even uploading anything.  It's a chore and takes a long time.)  Never mind the fact that there are hundreds of dupe songs uploaded everytime I sync.Genres:  I'm a nut about tagging my music.  I will tag my music separating the tag with a "";"" for each tag.  Amazon doesn't recognize this and now I have 736 different Genres.  Useless.Pluses:  You can buy music on Amazon and it's there ready to stream on the app immediately.  If you get your music from other sources you have to wait until you get home, download the music to your hard drive then start the whole manual upload to Amazon to get it there...Large storage space to allow me to upload everything (and I mean a lot) in my music library."

There is NO EQ that I can find, and not control over bit quality for those wanting less or more quality. It shows duplicates in the lists. It showed Joe Satriani under Steve Vai's artist filter. There is a fair amount of choice. There is no way to share or auto post ""What I am listening to""  to FB, or Google+ or Twitter. There are no skins or way to get a smaller compact player. The one option is not much of an option and still too big, and lacking basic info. There is potential here, but as it stands I can get my music by other means once I am no longer in school."

"12463","Amazon","Stop Outsourcing and Fix My App","Public Relations Student","May 17, 2016",3,"I truly enjoy my Amazon Prime music subscription. Being a college student, it's super cheap and easy. I have always loved the app...until now. Now whenever I download music or I am streaming it I cannot let my phone screen turn off. If my screen turns off it stops streaming and downloading. I thought that it might be my internet, but it does that with every WiFi system I have been on and my data.I have contacted Amazon but they were no help. Seemed like Amazon outsources their app tech support."
"12464","Amazon","So far it's got nothing on Spotify","Danielle","November 7, 2016",2,"Super hard to use. Confusing setup. Worst of all it takes forever to individually select songs to move to playlists once downloaded. Song selection still lacking."

"12467","Amazon","Something wrong with downloads","Ondroad","May 23, 2017",3,"Having trouble with music downloaded not fully loaded or something because the music stops before the song is over and goes into the next song. I think it may be the interface with iTunes?"
"12468","Amazon","Amazon Music Prime = GREAT! but one BIG issue.","Mario Fialho","June 17, 2014",2,"My wife and I have one Prime Membership.  We do not need two. We love this new Prime Music addition.  AWESOME!  However, both of us cannot listen to our Prime Music at the same time. This setting is counter intuitive!!!  This throttling should be set to ""two devices"" at an absolute minimum to support the typical family.  We have four kids and do things separately all the time.  We don't want to clog up our phones by downloading the songs every time we want to listen to them, so we the use of the CLOUD.  We also use Amazon for all of our Movie storage, via Rokus.  The whole idea of having an App and the cloud is to PREVENT this downloading business.  We have been BIG fans of Amazon over ITunes, ever since they crashed LALA into the ground and will remain Amazon faithful, please make this happen!"

"12471","Amazon","Good service, app needs improvement.","Amazon Customer","October 16, 2016",3,"The subscription service might get me to switch from Google Play Music, but this app needs work. It's a bit of a hassle to navigate, but my biggest gripe is when I go to ""my music"" and click on an artist I'm taken to a list of every song by the artist in a big stupid list. Example: Click on ""The Beatles"" and I'm staring at the top of a huge list of songs. This is a pain. Also wish I could store more of my music on the Amazon Cloud."
"12472","Amazon","Very Good, But Room For Improvement","christopher reis","October 4, 2012",4,"I'm a big fan of this app, but it still has some shortcomings that just drive me up the walls:1. Sorting. ""The Beatles"" should not be sorted under the letter ""T."" The sorting works fine in the iOS version, but for some reason, on Android, it's a mess.2. When opening the app, it should default to ""Artists"" not albums. It's logical for people to think, ""oh, I feel like listening to [artist]"" rather than thinking of an album first. It's one extra click, but it's a fairly obvious thing. And this is something that only recently changed, it used to work just fine.3. Random songs on my cloud drive just won't appear on the mobile app. Haven't figured out what causes this to happen. Sometimes deleting and re-uploading the track works, other times the missing song might just randomly reappear. Whatever causes this needs to be resolved.4. User's should be allowed to shut off ""Upgraded Audio."" Great, so I rip my MP3's at 256 to 320kbps (VBR) using the LAME MP3 encoder, and Amazon tells me that they're ""upgrading"" my audio to 256kpbs? Last I checked, 256kbps was of a lower quality than 320kpbs.5. Could use an editable EQ. Currently it has presets you can cycle through, but I'd like the ability to edit the EQ settings myself."
"12473","Amazon","Very dissatisfied","Quackeliminator","February 23, 2015",2,"I jumped in with both feet with this app and decided I was going to love it..Prime music, the cloud storage....I really tried to give it my all.  Calling it a resource hog is polite. My Galaxy S4 with 16GB of internal and 32GB of external was no match. If you have any kind of a music library say goodbye to your internal memory.  I love the prime music but it is worthless when you can't use it. Amazon does so many things well...whoever approved this app can't be much of a music lover.....or they are a former iTunes programmer. I agree with one of the other reviewers in that it would almost be easier to rip music and use media player.  Very frustratied and disappointed."
"12474","Amazon","5 stars for Amazon Prime Music!","Michael Kushner","September 4, 2017",5,"I am truly enjoying Prime Music. The variety of available artists, albums, genres and songs is very entertaining for me. And, a great break from my huge jukebox of digital music. I would recommend this Amazon streaming service to anybody I know. I have done just that, with great response."

I have had problems waiting 4 days for a downloads to appear.  and today all my playlists are messed up or missing.  my cloud playlists are empty.  Its all so so annoying because it takes forever to set up the playlists in the first place.  This will be the 5th or 6th time i have had to re-do my playlists on amazon music.The whole package is full of bugs.  and now its time to scrap it and find something else that just works everytime."
"12476","Amazon","Complete Garbage","Stone","March 9, 2016",1,"This is a garbage application.  Very slow and unresponsive.  When I upload music, it takes forever to update in the app and most of the time I end up closing and reopening it.  Can't say I like it very much at all."
"12477","Amazon","Terrible service don't waste your money.","Tye Hardison","February 26, 2017",1,"Sucks on my Android phone, even at home on a fast wifi connection it is constantly stopping to spool download music.  Useless on the road with a good 4G connection, it will never finish a song without stopping.  Don't pay for the $7.99 subscription as the library of music has shrunk.  The desktop app is just as bad with a limited selection of mostly very old stuff and albums that never made the top 25 of the music charts."
"12478","Amazon","While it's good to hear music on my phone","Sandra Silva","March 16, 2017",2,"While it's good to hear music on my phone,  I can't take my phone onto the production floor at work. I can take an mp3 player or a shuffle. However, what good is having all these songs if I can't transfer them to either device. It's not worth the membership price if you can't load them to the computer or mp3 player. I might as well cancel or demand a refund for products that I purchased but cannot use."

"12480","Amazon","(Temporarily?) Ruined by a recent update","ALK","October 14, 2016",1,"A recent update turned this app into a constantly crashing disaster on PC.  What's worse is that Amazon is not really communicating about the issue as of the time I posted this review.  I would avoid using this app at all costs until the problem is solved.It's a shame, given that I would have previously rated this app as a four-star app: I was genuinely happy with it before.  Of course, that was back when it was still functioning."
"12481","Amazon","Does this app run on anything?","Kyle Moyer","September 14, 2014",1,"If only I had the option to rate with a zero, or even a negative value... I have three tablets and two phones linked to my Amazon account, and this app is incompatible with all of them (one is even a kindle!) Seriously!? Great 'benefit' of my prime subscription that I can't even use the thing. Sure, I could use the PC app and listen at my computer, but I rarely listen at my computer. Most of music listening is done while working outside or driving. I'm usually against the all caps screaming in reviews but... AMAZON FIX YOUR APP, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!Though, from the sounds of all the other reviews, I'm better off not having it on my devices to begin with. Guess I dodged a bullet? Seriously reconsidering my prime subscription now."

I think that it really is the worst piece of software I have used in the last 10 years. Vile. Makes me want to find the name of the people who coded it and do bad things. Sorry to shout people- AMAZON, JUST LET US DOWNLOAD OUR MUSIC WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT YOUR STUPID ADVERTISING. IT'S NOT WORKING. Whew! I'm using iTunes more when I remember just how terrible this thing is. Go ahead, try it. You will see."
"12485","Amazon","Violates Our Privacy","Robert Delahunt","April 27, 2015",1,"It worked great for a long time.  It would constantly run, but you could close it.  I loved everything about it ... until an update changed its behavior.  Now it was reading the SIM card on my phone for no reason.  This is a horrible violation of privacy, so I uninstalled it.  I still use Amazon Music for MP3 because there's nothing better, but for now I'll just manually copy the MP3s to my phone and use Google Play Music app to play the songs while I am jogging.Dear Amazon: until you change the behavior of this application back to where it's not violating our privacy, I am not using your app.  Fix that, and I'll reinstall it."
"12486","Amazon","great additional benefit to prime membership","Amazon Customer","August 7, 2014",4,"As a free added benefit to prime membership, I have absolutely no complaints. Missing quite a few artists as I expected, but not too bad. There is currently no landscape mode, as far as I can tell. And being able to create your own playlist is a missing feature that I must have. But, as a benefit that I did not expect from Amazon, I have no complaints.  If I didn't have Prime, I would probably skip this."

Downloaded a ton of stuff locally to my phone.  Things played well at home, etc.But... plugged the thing into Android Auto.  Maybe one or two of my playlists will appear in the ""Recent Playlists"" section.. and that seems iffy at best.Also, even when the lists appear... it seems that AM is pulling the music from online, not the downloaded music I have.  This is annoying as hell as i get skips, etc that there should be no reason for.The recommended stuff lists are of no use to me... but there is no way to kill it.I think once my free preview of the service is done... i'm letting it go."

"12490","Amazon","Don't have a thing if it ain't got that swing","ken","June 20, 2014",2,"App is splashy, but had to be authorized from a computer, which is silly.  Signing up on your computer was just a method for driving hits to the site for popularity.  Problem was that it was not intuitive in navigation and therefore irksome.  The app looks fine, feels fine, but overall is veneer over cheap wood.  It's a bit clunky and goes for jukebox vintagey feel over function.  The app got locked up on trying to upload my music from my ipad.  No option to bypass, only sit there and wait.  Felt like a Microsoft product at Walmart.  I've purchased music and films at Amazon, but no cross-refencing to create suggestions or no ability for you to read a spotify playlist or even take a suggestion from the getgo.  This is clearly a rush job by an asynchronous team who had to take a shelved product to market after it finally passed through legal or something that held it up.So its available, but not fun to use.  Perhaps it will be fixed, but for now, luckily, there are other apps that sing and play.  This one will have to stay in from recess."
"12491","Amazon","The worst app I've never used.","Ben Rowan","October 24, 2015",1,"I don't use Amazon Music. I never have and have no intention to. But to use the weather app I downloaded from the Amazon App Store, I must be logged into the Amazon App Store. Which means I'm also logged into Amazon Music. So not only am I running 3 apps for no good reason, but Amazon Music constantly crashes. And I do mean constantly. Every 5 minutes or so what I'm doing on my phone is interrupted so that I can be notified that Amazon Music, the app I never downloaded or opened or used, has crashed. It happened twice while typing this.Amazon, you suck."
"12492","Amazon","It sucks, i can't even figure out how to use ...","bob  lou","January 21, 2017",1,"It sucks, i can't even figure out how to use it. Every time you click on something a pop-up for unlimited comes up. The playlist suck at least for the artist I was looking for. After reading the other reviews I'm glad I didn't get to far with it. I don't want having control of my phone or anything else.There are plenty of other places to get my music without the aggravation this app puts you through. No thanks!"
"12493","Amazon","Less German songs please","Christoph Köpernick","February 23, 2017",3,"At least when using Music in Germany, almost one third of the songs from the playlists are in German. Even in obviously international playlists. Neither foreigners nor Germans usually like German music, but a fraction of people. I'm about to switch back to Spotify due to this. Please clear your playlists and provide some German-only playlists instead for the special interest folks. I'm German by the way ;) Thank you"
"12494","Amazon","a great addition to android.","Ben A","April 20, 2011",4,"I'm running amazon mp3 on a nexus S. this app is great. cloud player works very well and sounds excellent. only issue I've had is with some buffering which seems to take forever but mobile reception is always a bit of a gamble. if I'm in a 3g area with full bars Cloud Player just works.I wish I could upload directly from my phone but that's my only gripe with the app. all the people complaining about how it doesn't work with their phone need to really assess the criteria that they buy phones with. get stock Android whenever possible."
"12495","Amazon","looks good at first","ME","August 26, 2016",1,"looks good at first, but after you spend lots of hours building play lists and downloading ""off line songs"", they start disappearing.  Play lists get messed up and disappear.  They seem to be baiting and switching.  Songs don't stay authorized for Off line or Prime.  Having to spend hours every week rebuilding play lists and downloading and getting somewhere off line and having no music is a real pain.  I will not be signing up for prime again."
"12496","Amazon","Can not store on external SD card and stream is bad for low BW.","Edward Diaz","May 15, 2013",1,"I love this player until I learned that I could not store offline music on my external sdcard. The streaming is also horrible for low bandwidth, while Pandora still streams well.I have a MetroPCS 4G plan with a 250Mb/month limit. When I am below my limit streaming is good however, when Metro starts to throttle my band width because I have exceeded my limit, streaming is intermittent(not usable). However, during these ""low band width"" condition, Pandora still streams extremely well, seems that Amazon could fix this!As a work around I decided to store locally, however I noticed that YOU CANT store on your external sdcard. At this point I have stopped purchasing from Amazon MP3. I would love it, if they could fix the external storage problem. Since you are forced to store on your phone's internal flash memory, you quickly start having issues with system performance (ie no space for mail..and so forth).Great product if you have unlimited 4G. Hopefully Amazon can fix these issues."
"12497","Amazon","This sux, the older version allowed you to used ...","FrictionBurn","May 25, 2015",1,"This sux, the older version allowed you to used the app w/out having to stay logged in to listen to the music located on your device. Now you can't even use the app unless you have an amazon account and internet connection. The old version worked perfectly, was reliable and did everything I needed it to do. Sadly, now that you've changed it I will be looking for a different player."
"12498","Amazon","data usage was bad","Anonymous","May 20, 2013",1,"I only used it to download 6 songs and 1 album. Then I played two tracks and the data usage was over 500 MB. The other app Google(?) registered very little. I guess this app would be okay when used at home or at a public wifi but I'm usually on the road. I'm an avid fan of Amazon (4 kindle purchases, Amazon Prime and the bulk of my online purchases come via Amazon) but  of this app? Not so much."
"12499","Amazon","Great music for all your moods!!!","Theresa","July 21, 2017",5,"This app is so easy to use. It has great music!!! You can put your own playlist together or they already have fabulous playlists ready to go. Any music lover will LOVE this app!!!"
"12500","Amazon","Horrible application interface and annoying when playing music","Amazon Customer","June 17, 2015",1,"I have many years experience in writing software and this app has a horrible GUI interface. The app has been programmed to interrupt every 10 minutes to retrieve and update the music library information on the device. it stops playing while updating. A totally dumb way to do this.it should update the library upon initialization and a control provided for the user to manually retrieve an update.  Amazon Prime Music would be a 5 star system if this application worked without annoying the listener. In my opinion the customer is wasting time adding prime music to their  device. Cannot listen to it uninterrupted."

But I only had a ""stupid phone"" not a ""smart phone"".  I wasn't eligible to get a ""smart phone"" until Oct 2010.  It was helpful for when my husband got a song and I wanted it...no need to find a thumb drive.  Just go get on amazon...sweet!  However, I wanted one of those smart phones.  I was looking at the EVO 4G, not the 3d one, and I was absolutely sold on it when I learned it came with this pre-installed.  However, waiting gets the best of us.  I decided to get Sprint's HTC EVO 4G View tablet.  I thought the 7"" display would make me happier b/c face it, it might be cool with unlimited internet on that phone, but if you run the battery down or get tired of the 4 inch display it will frustrate you.  And this had wifi--something I already had at home and was used to using and will use a LOT.  It gave me internet when I needed it and wifi when I didn't.  This way I get what I wanted (android stuff) and I didn't have to wait.But definately one of my main reasons was to get away from itunes....can I have your credit card number every time I upgrade....uh no sorry I'm in the middle of dishes and I can't get that....plus if I buy something here, which I love doing for the points and other reason...then it's available on my PC...unlike on itunes where you have to have ipods connected to certain accounts and stuff and lots of log on things and hook the device to the computer.....this is much easier.  I got my tablet last Sunday and by today not only did I download all I wanted from my cloud...plus I can shop from the tablet...but I put all my old amazon songs on my card and it went into the cloud player...even the itunes stuff...with no problems.  No searching this folder or that.  I think I may have just replaced itunes and my ipod with my tablet and this cloud player.The only thing I didn't like was that for some reason I can't figure out how to not download a whole album...but that doesn't take away from this b/c I did figure out how to delete stuff from the player :)If you love amazon, want great music that is easy to get to, and want to go droid this app is great. I am currently shopping for music as we speak ;)"
"12506","Amazon","Doesn't work anymore","P. Anderson","June 30, 2014",1,"If I had submitted a review immediately after I installed the app, I would have given it a pretty high rating. It did exactly what I wanted and did it well. The most recent update, however, seems to have borked things. The app stopped working about 7-10 days ago and is completely useless now. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled and then re-installed the app, and done everything else I could think of and nothing has helped. It stays at the log in screen. I input my email and password and it either crashes or tells me I've input the wrong info. I know the info is correct because the PC and ios versions of the app work fine, it is just the android version that seems to be broken. Hopefully a future update fixes this problem because I want to use this app."

I was excited when Prime Music was announced and spent time collecting some favorite tracks.  Now, onle a few weeks later a large majority of those tracks are no longer available with Prime Music.  How frustrating, disappointing, and unprofessional of Amazon.  Actually, rather un-Amazon like.  If there are issues of royalty, those should have been settled before any track was released or made available to Prime customers.  What am I supposed to do now?  Spend more hours to clean up my Library and Playlists?I am usually happy with Amazon and their service, but this time I must say I am VERY (CAPITAL LETTERS) DISAPPOINTED.  Hopefully someone in Amazon reads my feedback and will take some action."

"12510","Amazon","Lack of major feature, and a very annoying bug, but functional.","Eric","August 8, 2014",3,"Been using this since Amazon Cloud Player, and the new updates are less than thrilling.As another reviewer pointed out, you can't make and save playlists to cloud. I run amazon music on my laptop and phone, and playlists have to be made separately for each device.More annoying still is that imported mp3s to my phone are being made into weird albums. Any album with more than one artist contributing (soundtracks for instance) are separated into as many ""albums"" as there are artists in said album. This is ridiculous. Additionally, there doesn't appear to be any manual way to fix it.Aside from these two major irritations, the app functions as advertised. Otherwise I would rate it lower."

Then contacting support who simply said that you can't return digital music. I told them I already have the album, along with 20,000 other songs. So on each one I can pick up my phone and accidentally buy it if I'm not careful. Also, no way to turn off one-click ordering? So I'm deleting and moving my music. I seriously spend so much money on Amazon, being blatantly screwed really makes me want to take ALL of my business elsewhere. It is almost like I'm sad that they can't just be better and have common sense. Can't they add a ""ARE YOU SURE"" button..."

"12515","Amazon","Frustrating - Interface is needlessly confusing and difficult","M. Stoneman","December 8, 2016",2,"This app is very challenging to use.  First, while it's intuitive to search, once you have music picked you want to listen to, it is difficult to find it once again.  Amazon programmers, I'd invite you to take a look at the Spotify interface. Right now on Amazon music, I can neither find playlists or albums I have listened to previously. I have largely given up because it is so complicated to navigate."

"12519","Amazon","Unable to save music to SD Card","Joshua Abell","September 12, 2012",2,"The inability of this app to save downloaded music to my external SD card earns it a two star deduction. That's kinda the whole point of me getting an SD card. I have awful signal at work, so I can't use streaming, and the SD card issue really limits the amount of music I can download to my device. I really like most of the rest of the app, but that simple limitation makes it really hard to love the app in total."

The app can ONLY download to the phone's memory (same with my Motorola Droid X), and NOT my external micro SDHC card (where I, like many, store MUSIC/pictures/videos). The music tracks are like 7MB each. And don't blab to me about the Cloud Drive. While that sounds great in theory, with only Sprint keeping unlimited data plans available (I just lost mine in this last phone upgrade), streaming music all the time is not gonna cut it. I end up having to download the songs onto my PC, then syncing it to my phone's SD card (using Samsung Kies... argh.... slow... but blame that on Android losing UMS and going MTP). Ugghhhh......

If you have this playing with navigation running it will not mute or reduce the volume like other music apps do. Also external controls for skipping to the next track or pausing the music do not work. This app can only function as a stand alone and is useless if anything else is running."

"12523","Amazon","Music, music, everywhere!","K. Ethier","February 2, 2015",5,"I am really thrilled with Amazon Music. I started with the app for PC so I could enjoy my Amazon Prime Music benefits on my computer, but then added Amazon Music to my Galaxy Note and Kindle Fire. I am really sold on this, and here's why:Being a Prime member, I can add a wide variety of music to my cloud storage for free, which is exactly what I did. Hundreds of songs - FREE! Not only that, but I also organized all of the music on my computer and set up playlists, which I realize is something that other software can do, but no other software gives you all of the advantages of Amazon Music with Prime Music.I've purchased quite a bit of music from Amazon over the years and all of the music was available within Amazon Music. How convenient! I now no longer have to cart around CDs when I travel - I just fire up the Amazon Prime app and can access the music I've purchased, plus all of the free Prime Music I can handle. There is a wide enough variety there to satisfy even my eclectic tastes.If you have existing audio on your devices, you can add it to the app and organize it into playlists as well. The one thing I've not been able to do, however, is combine both locally-stored music with music stored in the cloud. I'm not sure it's possible to do so. Even with that drawback, however, I find this app immensely useful.I noticed some other people are complaining about how difficult/clunky it is to use. To be honest, I thought it was really straightforward and easy to use. One complaint that I saw says you can't use your newly-purchased music unless you download everything again... I bought some new music yesterday and I downloaded just the new music. It was very simple to figure out and download. Perhaps the complainers had an older version of the app?If you are a Prime member and love music, I think you'll like this app. I wholeheartedly recommend it."

There is NO REASON that this app should not allow the user to select where the songs and associated data are stored.  NO REASON. I have a 64GB SD card and cannot store any of my Amazon Music on it (unless I use root to mount the SD card folder on the internal storage.) KitKat allows an app to use an SD card, just not read folders created by other apps. Amazon, please allow your paying customers to select where they want to store THEIR music.Although it is nice to have the ability to download Prime Music, the decision to store the encrypted music in the Amazon Music app data directory (Android/data/com.amazon.mp3) not only means that it will be stored in internal storage, but will also get backed up by apps like Titanium Backup. If you keep a history of multiple backup files, you end up with multiple copies of the same Amazon Prime Music you have downloaded. Since the music is encrypted, why not allow the user to select where it is stored?Worst of all, if you need to reinstall the Amazon Music app, all of the encrypted Prime Music you have downloaded will no longer play and must be deleted and re-downloaded. I do not know how the Prime Music encryption key is created, but it would be appreciated if there was a way to re-authenticate Prime Music already downloaded."

There is no 'playlist' file that can be transferred or updated to find the newly relocated music.  Now you just have a playlist on your phone that has '0' songs in it.Storage location is a must for this type of app."

However, I recently added Chromecast Audio throughout my house, and Amazon for some reason refuses to support it.  When I use the Amazon app, I'm stuck using a single stereo in my house, and that's not good enough for me.

I picked up Equalizer from the Google Play Store and now I love my music again, but wait - I use my Kindle Fire alot. For those of you who don't know you can't get regular Android Apps on your Fire - only Amazon App Store Apps where there are a total of five if you do a search for ""equalizer"".

Brinkmann","December 12, 2012",1,"Only one star as there's currently no way to configure where the app stores downloaded music. On my Samsung Galaxy S3 it ends up on the internal sdcard, taking up valuable storage space required for apps. So after downloading the music using the app, I have to manually copy the files to my external 64GB sdcard. Talk about usability... To me this makes the whole player as such a waste of time.What point is an integrated player/downloader if an additional manual step is required every time I want to store the music locally? The cloud feature is great when listening on the desktop but with the phone I often listen to music when there's no stable or only a very slow internet connection (e.g. when on a plane or long-distance train).So only one instead of 4 or 5 stars, as the software as such is not usable right now. Just download the files via the desktop, copy them over to the phone's external sdcard and use the built-in mp3 player. Much better user experience and less hassle!"

After 3 or 4 days, I was much more familiar with the phone. I discovered, by accident, that some things opened under my finger that I didn't think were ""touch"" spots. Who knew?Once I figured that out, I started touching more of the icons and words in the Amazon MP3 Cloudplayer window, which opened things I didn't expect  to open. There's no *PING* light bulb over my head, by any means. But it was a valuable experience.I can't say that it's terribly intuitive; it's not. It just takes messing around with this app to get more familiar with it - the more you use it, the more things you discover.In fact, right now I am listening to a song by Billy Joel. But when I was trying to show my daughter how this player system works, it wouldn't do exactly what I wanted, the way I thought it would. Poo.After years of iTunes, it's just going to be a matter of learning a new system. I just hope Cloudplayer is more reliable about maintaining the catalogue of songs I've purchased through this app - so I can download them again in case of catastrophe. iTunes really completely failed to do that, despite their reassurances all your purchased music could be retrieved. I just hope Amazon's Cloudplayer system actually works in that respect. Hopefully I'll never have to find out.Now, I'm going to figure out how to get music from my MacBook Pro's iTunes to migrate to my Droid X, and into Cloudplayer. (If you hear screaming, it's just me, but I'll tap something that looks suspicious, & maybe that will do the trick. At least that's my evil plan...)"

If I used a Mac, iphone, and ipod perhaps the choice would have been easier, except that I like my music in MP3 format, so even though I use iTunes for my collection at home, I do not buy music from the Apple Music Store.  I buy my music from Amazon.Having the Amazon MP3 app available on my iphone and my Android tablet makes it easy to access my music from any device.  The apple version of the app even lets me stream through my home stereo using Apple TV. I tried the free Google Play service but found it to be utter crap as I was not able to access my online music on an Android tablet.itunes match did not work for me as there is no Android app for it, and it does not store music as MP3.

That's just wrong & bad business! But I'll lose music if I try to merge the 2 accounts into 1 account. If the 2nd prime account had not been mistakenly allowed to happen  (yep - no warning!!!), I'd say this is a win-win & great. But instead I have to switch from account to account to access various music! That's what ""Customer Service"" told me to do because there was no solution. With Today's Technology - I don't think so, unless a software was made & not fixed.....I love being an Amazon Prime Member, but not having 2 accounts & loosing prime & possibly bought music too if I merge my accounts.Trust me I tell folks that it's better to be an Amazon Prime Member than to belong to Costco & such for countless reasons. This isn't 1 of those reasons.So get this app, but make it attached to an already existing account or build your account through this.The Subscribe And Save is Wonderful!!!

I like being able to search, listen to samples, buy, download, and add to a playlist, and listen to the playlist all from a single app on my phone. Streaming from the cloud is ""cool"", but it will kill your battery quick and run up your data plan if you do it often. This feature is better used on the web browser interface for streaming to a work PC or tablet.This app has quite a few problems that keep it at three stars. Amazon needs to fix these issues and this player will be great:1) Music skipping issues. I thought it was just me, but this is noted in other reviews too. I'm playing from local storage and not using cloud streaming, so connectivity isn't an issue.2) Needs an equalizer. Every other Android music app I've seen needs one too. Stock sound coming out of Android is terrible. It is very ""tinny"" sounding. It's not my headphones because I used these same ones on a Creative Labs player that has an EQ and they sound great.3) Needs a better random song algorithm. I keep getting the same songs played back to back or multiple times within several songs. ""Random"" should mean that each song gets played ONLY once in a random order until the entire playlist has been played.4) Needs ability to push playlists created On-Device to the cloud so I can save the playlist and access it elsewhere."

No gaps in streaming either during or between songs.- Clean interface. Easy to navigate.- Stream can be forwarded via bluetooth (A2DP)The Bad:- Spendy - I'm hoping that the price get's driven down as adoption with cloud computing takes off. It's true you get the first year free but that's just the hook. After that you're looking at a buck a gig per year basically, or $20 per year. The pricing is also tiered so that you can't just add 5 gigs as you need them, it jumps from 20 to 50 to 100 to 500 and finally 1000 gigs, or a Terabyte. I would very much like to see this model disappear and be replaced with an 'on demand' model where I'm not forced into paying for storage I'm not using.- Auto resume - Currently when a txt message or call comes in the player pauses but does not resume once the txt / call is complete.

I have both downloaded music from my cloud drive and uploaded it onto both devices and both work great.  My one major complaint is that once you create a playlist or add songs to now playing, you CANNOT drag and drop the songs to change the order.  You have to delete the songs and add them again in the order you want.  I usually don't use the shuffle feature because I like to listen to songs in a particular order if they seem to go together well.On my phone, the ability to skip songs or pause without having to unlock the screen is pretty nice, and I will give them credit that it is innovative.Overall, the app has functioned fine and played music fine, but not being able to easily change the order of my songs is a huge drawback."

Cloud play is great. I read some ppl claiming that their music got lost. If this is the case for u make sure when buying ur music it was saved to the cloud drive. All music bought from amazon is free to store in the cloud and unlimited. However uploaded music is limited to 5gb which is quite small.  So when choosing b/w Google Music and Amazon that's something to consider. Both players are equally good. I think the deciding factor here is where you have bought more music. personally I have bought more from Amazon BC of the $5 alblums which are cheaper than what Google sells music for.1annoying thing is the app does emphasize the store part of the app as much as the player. The album view could also be made to look more aesthetic."

Also I couldn't buy any book by my creditcard, there always signal appears me that ""your billing method is non-US"". How long it will continue that I can't use my kindle fully and losing so many great opportunities like can't download my favourite artist's song or can't buy my favourite books etc even i use Kindle Fire. I hope that you(Amazong) will resolve these issues for not only me, other many foreign customers who have stuck on the same problem as me.Thank you"

I'm looking for a mp3 player which will display Podcast Info and subtitles embedded within mp3 files as the audio is played.  This is not state it does in the descriptions nor was it able to.  So I'm giving the neutral ratting of 3. However, the cloud storage works great!  I will upgrade to 5 stars should this app be updated to do this.  You are welcome to leave a comment to my review should you  know of on which does this.Background info of what I'm looking for:My Chinese lessons mp3 files have Chinese phonetic, English translation, and Chinese characters along with the audio. This makes them very useful to learn the foreign language.  The size of my Kindle Fire is perfect for studding my lessons. However, the KF MP3 player and this app does not do this.To enable this feature for Windows Media Player, to the following:Right click screen on WMP, mouse over pop up menu ""Lyrics captions subtitles"", click ""On if available""To enable this feature on an iPod Touch MP3 player (may be the same for iPhone and iPad), do the following:Settings->Music->Lyrics & Podcast Info - ON"

I can quickly access cloud content, purchase music, download it to my phone, play from the cloud, etc.I need to be able to specify a different download directory. The app won't allow me to. When I attempt to move the content from one location to another the playlist duplicates every individual track. One references the old location (where the file no longer exists) and the other references the new location (where the file currently exists and can be played normally.) I contacted support and they were unable to resolve this problem for me. Their best suggestion was to manually go through and delete out the old tracks, one by one. For anyone with more than just a couple of mp3s downloaded to their device, this process can be very tedious, cumbersome and time consuming.The player works well enough. The music store limits the number of results returned on searches and in category views. This can prevent me from browsing music the way I would like. I would like to see this limit removed, and instead add pagination to allow me to browse more content.This could easily be a 5 star app, but these issues are glaring oversights that impact the overall experience."

I used on the s2. With my increased storage on the s5. I'd like to download all my cloud music. It would be nice to be able to see what is out of sync and download it like the desktop offers. I'll probably use windows and my sd card to sync the music because the player is cumbersome.I've started using the android player. It has the search function that isn't in the amazon app. It needs some improvement."
"12601","Amazon","Excellent, but not ideal yet","J Daniels","August 6, 2011",4,"The concept of this cloud player has some wonderful benefits -- same library of content available to all your devices, regardless of where you are.  The fact that Amazon's library is based on the open MP3 format instead of any DRM format also makes it much more robust and useful.  This is the first serious competition to Apple's iTunes w/o most of the headaches associated with that platform.  However, there are some issues that should be addressed to make this a more robust player:1) The ability to d/l a playlist to your device without downloading the space-consuming songs in that playlist.2) The ability to shuffle the songs in a playlist.  Google Music can do this, and it is one of the few things it can do that Amazon Cloud Player can't.  This should be a simple s/w fix.3) When you display the list of all songs, it would be nice to see what playlist each song belongs to, if any.  It's a chore to search your entire library to find any orphaned songs.There are other features that I could request to make this a dream app, but these features alone would make it much closer to ideal for me.  Add these features, and I would give it a full 5 stars."
"12602","Amazon","Purposfully Confusing.","Stanislav Gatev","May 5, 2015",1,"The only rational explanation I can find for Prime Music being so ridiculously messed up is that Amazon is trying to confuse their users and have them spend money that they wouldn't otherwise. I could not find a way to see tracks which are included with Prime, and stay within Prime. They would insert one or two paid tracks in the search results. The UI is so clumsy and confused, I couldn't make sense of it. I am software engineer, and have seen many pieces of software - some good, some dab, and some downright ugly. This one is ugly."
"12603","Amazon","A solid first effort","Tyler Brandt","April 4, 2011",4,"Out of nowhere Amazon has a very compelling Android music player. Streaming works great and I didn't have any of the hiccups that I nearly always had with Rdio, MOG, Rhapsody, and Audiogalaxy, even on 3G. I think it even autobuffers the next song, which the above apps all failed to do, despite claiming it as a feature.There are a few features that would make it way cooler, though:1. Unify cloud music and device music. This could be replaced by a simple icon for one or the other, and would make it easier to see what you had on each, without flipping back and forth.2. Be able to access your wishlist/shopping lists from the app. Buying music and having it available instantly in cloud player is awesome, but it's a pain to have to go to Amazon.com to pick up the albums that I've already saved in my lists.3. Fix the uploader application for Windows. If you don't use iTunes or WMP, it has to crawl your hard drive and those results are organized by folder rather than tag, and on-drive folder structure is not preserved, which makes it excessively difficult to upload all albums by a given artist."

All I can say is that I will not EVER use iTunes again.  I have a total love affair with my iPad and iPhone, but I have never had any great love lost for iTunes.  Now with this really great application, I will not ever worry about it again...ever.First of all--if for nothing else--there are more than a million songs available on Prime Music.  You have to do nothing more than choose the music you want to listen to then download it to your device (even prime music can be downloaded to a tablet or smart phone).  When it has been downloaded to your tablet or smart phone, then you can listen without streaming.  Hours and hours of music, and a whole host of it for free!  There are also pre-created playlists that Amazon suggests, and you can add this playlist with a simple click, touch, or swipe of the finger!Then any music you have purchased in just about forever is available on your Amazon cloud.  The trick to getting pre-existing music from the cloud to show up on your device is to add a playlist in your cloud (which I just titled ""all my music"") and then select your music to add to a playlist.  Then once it's in a playlist, you can download all your music at once with the download arrow on your device.Also, if you have uploaded music to your Amazon cloud, that music is there, too!After you've downloaded music, if you don't want it, then you swipe the song to the left, and it gives you the option to delete.  (The same left-swipe option allows you to download single songs-instead all your songs-from the cloud.)This application works FLAWLESSLY on my iPhone.  A coworker has an android smartphone, and it works flawlessly on hers, too.This is now my go-to app for all my music.  I do not use iTunes at all.  I can find ALL my music.  I also like the various ways I can look at music, either in a list or individually.  I can mix so that I am playing tunes in random order instead of hearing the same list over and over again. I can listen to my entire Amazon music library on the computer, through my tablet or phone, just practically anywhere.This app is IT for me.  Thanks, Amazon!  Job well done...again and again and again.One more thing: if you're having trouble making the app work for you, then try Amazon's help link for the Amazon Prime Music App.  Go to Prime Music in Amazon, and keep clicking on links that say ""Learn more about Prime Music"" until you get to the Amazon Help.  There, you will find a three-minute video about Amazon Prime Music.  Also there are additional links in the left-hand column (if you're on your PC) that will benefit you, too.Happy listening!!"

There was over 50 different album arts downloaded, most of which I never purchased and some was offensive. I don't know if this was a fluke or not but the way to see is  plug your phone into your computer, (make sure the USB connect is on Disc Drive on your phone) open up either drive E or F and look in amazon.mp3 and then look in a folder called image.pics or something similar, and look at all the .jpeg files ( you can safely delete the .jpeg files without screwing you phone/computer up).I like Amazon as a whole, but this in not right and we as buyers should be able to decide what we want on our devices, not someone else.This would be the perfect music player, except for this one flaw, so one star as I did not download any music with offensive album art.As always, with ANYTHING on a hard drive or something similar , do this at your own risk, I'm not responsible if you screw your device(s) up."

And my final problem is that it does not sync my playlists between devices or at least let me move my playlists to the cloud.

I know I have the cd at home, but for some reason it was not on my phone. Thanks to Amazon Music Prime...I was about to go on there, and download it very quickly and we were off singing it all the way home (and kept the driver awake in the process, which was great). It was heaven to have it available and able to download so quickly. Very happy and made me appreciate the service all the much more (already love prime for the free 2 day shipping and use it all the time).

Amazon seems to be doing everything it can to hide how buggy their service is. The file tagging and upload interface is at best a proof of concept thrown together by some students... Adobe Air? Really? Most of my album artwork is completely wrong... I have a number of albums whose matched artwork is not only incorrect but offensive.

Then Amazon came out with the cloud player and I downloaded the app. The music downloaded into itunes fine but it would download each song into windows media player twice. Each time I bought an album I would have to go to the windows media player and delete songs because they would be two of every song. Then last week the app suddenly stopped connection to the internet. That is just after I purchase two albums. So now my music is in the cloud and not on my computer. So in effect I own two albums that I cannot listen to. This is over a week now and Amazon still has not solved the problem. So the Amazon cloud player gets a big fat F."

Every time I open it my list of music is empty. The service spends at least half an hour loading my cloud songs every time I open it, and that is even with a strong Wifi signal. Songs are still loaded to my phone's memory instead of the SD card, so downloading the stuff directly to my phone is a nightmare. The only way I can listen to my music is to download it from the site on my pc, then install it on my memory card and use the player, or another one, to listen to the songs. I don't know who is behind the development of the app. But if I were Jeff Bezos, then I'd put it into the hands of someone else. There is no reason that my entire playlist needs to be downloaded every single time I open the app. There is no reason that I should be denied the option of saving to the card instead of the phone."

The limited internal storage of the phone coupled with the brutal data allowances of verizon handcuff the use of this app at all.I loved having quick and easy access to my mp3 files from virtually anywhere, but now find this app almost useless.  Even went as far as uninstalling the app updates to strip it back down to the original version; which actually allowed the files to be saved directly to the sd card, but found that amazon has completely shut down the ability to sign in.In short....a year ago or less this app was a 5-star.

I have to hit the power button and swipe the lock screen to get the app to go to the next song. This pretty much defeats the purpose. Ergo I no longer use this app. I just listen to Pandora or Jazz Radio instead.Second, it's a nice idea to add extra free music for Prime members, but for anyone that listens to something other than current pop rock it's pretty useless. So, that's another reason to no longer bother with Amazon music.Too bad as the previous app worked perfectly."

However, the upgrades were limited and since the initial migration I have not had a single uploaded song meet Amazon's upgrade criteria.  As such, it has become more of a quality detractor.Bottom line, the Amazon Cloud experience is ""okay"" but has work to do before it can earn those extra stars..."

If I download something that's free because of my Prime membership, what happens if/when my Prime membership expires? Do the songs disappear or stop working then or what?

The x-ray lyrics is a great feature as well and follows the song pretty well. At times the x-ray lyrics can lag behind the song but Im pretty sure this is because Im listening via blutooth in my car (happens on utube as well). Overall its an amazing music player with tons of free music and pre programmed stations. Highly recommended!"

It's easy to use & I love having my entire music collection right there on the cloud for download anytime I like. The app is large but it allows you to move it your phone's sd card. Which is nice because my phone's internal storage is limited. However... I bought a 32gb sd card for my Droid X2 to have more room for music only to realize, after downloading a good portion of desired tracks from my extensive cloud music collection, that Amazon mp3 player will only download to my phone's internal storage.

I hope the player will see the music there.  If so, all will be well.  The player itself can happily reside on the phones internal storage while the data rich music is on the SD card.

If you are a Prime member it is a must have, especially since it's free.  You have access to thousands of songs from every genre of music.  You can create a library and store all of your favorite artists.  You can also download the music to your device in case you are on airplane mode on vacation or whatever.  You can also listen to stations, similar to Pandora, except there are no ads."

So, the small MP3 player I just purchased on the Amazon website to use while I am running, the MP3 player that just plays music files and doesn't load apps, the MP3 player that I will now be returning to Amazon, is totally useless. They should show this information in big bold letters from the get go instead of leading you to believe that you can download music onto your PC. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY PRIME MUSIC FILES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER. So, really not sure why they are calling these songs you can't download ""Prime music"", certainly makes it seem as though you as a ""Prime member"" would have access is a bunch of crap. I guess they are trying to justify the $99.00 a year fee they charge by giving you what amounts to another Pandora or Spotify. What a waste of time, and now I have an app I have to uninstall as well or maybe I should just run with my Kindle strapped to the side of my head."

There is a limitation to the Android operation system that doesn't allow widgets if it is on your SD card.  After doing this I was able to use the widget once again.  I have upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I do wish that the player had the ability to let me customize the equalizer to my tastes rather than the preset ones that they have.

It's a business process, not a personal issue, or a technical aspect.I suggest they should put down their phones and live life a bit. Maybe even put a soundtrack to it."

I KNOW that Amazon wants us enslaved to their cloud, but the reality is that Internet connections are not as reliable as Amazon believes. Could this be because Amazon lives in a wired city? See, I live in Portland, OR and we are very wired, too. HOWEVER, crap happens and with the Amazon Music app, you either download EACH album individually, which is tedious if you already have a large music library, OR you suck it up, Buttercup, and use the cloud. When is Amazon finally going to tell their sweatshop developers to have a ""Download All"" option in the app so that those of us who want to listen regardless of our ISP's current availability?!I'm sorry, but this is about as user-antagonistic an app as I've seen in a VERY long time, and I'm specifically talking about the new player, not some old one."

Being able to access both local and remote music files from a single application is an excellent step forward, though it'd be a bit better if they could be in one general listing (challenging as that might be to represent).This could easily become the 'daily driver' player, but like other reviewers I'd love to see two additions:1/ integration with the lock screen (ala Songbird)2/ Support for the scrobbling standards (e.g. with Last.FM or third party scrobblers).Putting these in a review is... unlikely to get a response, but a quick look around I couldn't see how best to add enhancement requests directly."

"12815","Amazon","Bait and Switch","Someone","November 19, 2012",1,"I'm one of the thousands of people who trusted Amazon when they said they were offering ""unlimited"" free music storage on Cloud Player. Given the initial bugs with their service, it took me a lot of work and time, but I eventually got my music on Cloud Player. After a few months, Amazon changes it to 5 GB. After another few months, Amazon states that there will be a 250 song limit but that limit wouldn't count previously uploaded mp3s.  Fast forward to last week: I tried playing some of the songs that I uploaded when Cloud Player was first announced, and I found that all of my uploaded songs were gone. The only songs that remained were the music that I purchased from Amazon over the past few months. Today I find out that your previously uploaded songs don't count towards the Cloud Player limit because Amazon moved all of my uploads into Cloud Drive where I can't access those songs from Cloud Player which makes it useless. Like many other people I'm not willing to pay $25.00 just because Amazon is being dishonest due to poor planning. In the future they shouldn't promise to offer services forever that are not financially sustainable, just to gain a temporary edge over competitors like Google.I can honestly say that I've been a loyal Amazon customer over the years. However if this is a start of a new trend with Amazon I guess I'll be shopping around for a new favorite store to patronize.I'm also sure of another thing: I won't be buying music from Amazon in the future. Conversely, Google treats my music files fairly. and that's where I'm moving my future media purchases."
"12816","Amazon","The Amazon MP3 app and music ecosystem is terrible. Does Amazon understand digital goods?","Ignatius Hsu","April 13, 2013",1,"The Amazon music listening and digital purchasing experience is characterized by one word, ""horrific"". Skip this app, save time, save the $24.99 annual fee, and use Google Music instead. Google Music is a competing cloud service free for up to 25,000 songs, and it just works. It's available from the Google Play storeThe Amazon MP3 app is buggy, clunky, looks dated and doesn't even offer genres for browsing through your library! Bluetooth cuts out frequently when I listen to songs through the app on my tablet. The app design says 2009 and it eschews the Android Holo design language for Amazon's awkward Kindle theme. The app starts you off on a screen where you have to select ""Store"" or ""Player"", and it doesn't seem to remember your preference, so you need to select ""Player"" each time you restart the app. That adds up to a lot of needless taps on your screen, which disrupts your listening experience. The app doesn't support genre browsing. You simply cannot use your music catalogue's genres. Don't bother with the Amazon MP3 app or Amazon's music ecosystem if you do any of the following: (1) purchase digital music (2) consume digital music (3) manage your music library (4) value your sensibilities as a consumer of music.The cloud service is clumsy to navigate is not truly Web based. You must supplement the Web based cloud player with several desktop apps to complete certain actions. The desktop downloader/uploader are equally as bad. Purchase songs and they're saved to the cloud and made available for free through Amazon Cloud Player. An ok start. Album art is 500px by 500px, also great.The rest of the Amazon MP3 experience is problematic. Album art from purchased songs is massive. A 700kb jpeg at 500px by 500px is gratuitous. Metadata is messy. Artists are not tagged correctly and Amazon makes no distinction between the Album Artist vs Artist metadata fields. Album titles have random words capitalized. Songs are inconsistently labeled. I need to re-tag the album metadata and update album art on my computer. So much for the phone app. Oh wait, you need to install a desktop app to download multiple MP3s, and you also need Adobe Air. And you need another desktop app to upload the updated songs. You also can't push updated songs from your desktop to the cloud (you need to make a list of each updated song, sign in to cloud player, delete each song, one by one from the cloud, then select each song from your desktop, and upload each song to the cloud. if you thought you could simply delete an album from the cloud and re-upload it, you're wrong.).Google Music offers a seamless purchasing and listening experience, is well integrated into Android, supports Genres and follows Android's design language. Google Music does this right. 25,000 songs uploaded to the cloud for free. Song management is almost perfect.The Google Music app starts up in the tab you last visited, so if you were in albums or artists, it picks up where you left off. You can purchase music, but consuming it is the heart of the app. Amazon's MP3 player emphasizes music purchases even though most of the app's users go to it to listen rather than shop for music. Songs I purchase from Google Play have tagged file metadata correctly (nice, Google!). Album art is perfect, Web optimized at 512px by 512px (close enough for me). The app has genre filtering and browsing. It allows you to randomize songs within a genre. The cover flow is very spiffy. I've invested time in getting my album art consistent so I could browse music visually as well as through metadata. I can see the effort bear fruit in this beautifully crafted app. The app uses the latest Android Holo design language, so looks consistent with the rest of the Android apps. It functions great and has a lock screen widget.Pushing updates from the desktop to the cloud is still a little challenging on Google Music, but nothing like the 80 steps per album Amazon experience. You can delete an album with two clicks. After that, it's 6 step process you complete once per batch of updates, whether it's an album or 100 albums. The cloud service is truly cloud based, and the user interface is elegant and intuitive. Like Amazon MP3, you need desktop software to upload music. Unlike Amazon MP3, in Google Play you can effortlessly download an entire album, delete it, or edit its metadata from the cloud, without the need for additional desktop software.The Amazon MP3 app is the opposite of Google Music. Go to Google Play, search for Google Music, and get started with an amazing music listening experience."
"12817","Amazon","It WAS great -- before they began charging for it","GobiasIndustries","August 8, 2012",1,"I loved this app, it was great to download all my Amazon MP3's directly to my phone, or providing the ability to stream them if I didn't want them taking up memory. Now Amazon has decided to make users pay $25/year to have as much music on there as you want, or you can keep 250 (Amazon mp3's not withstanding) if you don't want to pay for it.It was my go-to music app, but I don't like restrictions on the music I put on my phone, and I sure as hell won't pay $25 a year to access the music I already paid for or uploaded to my cloud drive on their site. If I'm paying for the extra storage space through Amazon Prime, I should be able to do what I want with it."

So, when I got my new phone and the app, I was happy to have almost my entire music library at my fingertips.Then came August 1st...I am a Prime member, and I remember when I started using the cloud.  They said that songs would not count against my 5GB of free cloud storage.  In fact, the web page still says that.  However, when I went in to my cloud player on 08/01, I got a pop up message saying that I could only have 250 songs imported songs for free.  An imported song is anything you didn't purchase from Amazon (although that is not true because many of my imported songs are from CDs I did purchase from Amazon).So, I have until 08/31 to have all my imported songs on the cloud.  After that, I will need to pay for anything over 250 songs, and I have over 3,000.  It will be $24.99 per year, I believe is what the message said, to keep all my imported songs on there.  Now, just over $2 per month is not a lot of money, but when they tell you that you have 5GB of free storage and that ""This space is yours to use as you like and you will never be charged for it."" (that is quoted from their website) and then they change it on you, it leaves a bad taste.I have deleted all of my imported music from the cloud.  I have been a big supporter of Amazon and bragged about their cloud player and the benefits of Prime membership.  I have also touted the Kindle Fire.  I'm very disappointed with the way Amazon handled this.  I have uploaded all my songs now to Google Music (20,000 free with them) and will just use their player from now on."

Its not how long I'm listening to the music, because Prime music will stop after 5 minutes or stop every 20 minutes, and I get a notification saying Amazon Prime has stopped. Would you like to report or close program. I have reported it  many times, with no result. So my only other option is to go back to Google Music play. I'm very disappointed with Amazon Prime, I was so excited about the Prime Music, but now it's just frustrating to try to listen to music using Amazon Prime.

We are living in free world, and not everybody that live in UK have English on their phones, if they can chioce something else. So, when you get different language (becouse you prefer it) you will not be able to use it. thats very big issue, becouse this users can buy music from their computers, that are also in diferent then english language, but on their phones NO!"

It's often hard to weed out the (inferior) remakes by listening to one short sample. You can get caught with a bunch of lousy remakes you bought without knowing. Some artists seem to have remade almost every song and usually. they aren't close to the quality of the original hit song. Maybe that's why the popular music scene is suffering compared with earlier times: don't bite the hand that feeds you.. I also noticed songs being added to my playlist that I didn't want. Don't know why, but annoying. They also kept throwing albums and choices out that  weren't even close to my preferences.Many searches for songs that were in the top twenty found no hits at all..

I love using the web-based Cloud Player on my pc to listen to music while at work.  Unfortunately, with the amount of music I have, the Android App (HTC EVO 4G) becomes very slow and crashes frequently.  I think problems are caused because the app is trying to locally cache my music library's index, so the app knows what music is available to stream from the Cloud Player's server.  The AmazonMP3 App's Data usage grows to just over 54MB after downloading the ""index"".  And that data stays on Android's internal memory, also causing space shortages on my phone.Once playing music, the app does a good job.  Rarely do I hear skips during a song, even while streaming over 3G connections, and song playback starts within reasonable time of hitting play.I would like to see Amazon refine the the AmazonMP3 App to work more efficiently with larger Cloud Player libraries.

I would simply rip only the best songs from my CD collection to be transferred to the Ipod in my car. Back when I had dial-up internet, I actually downloaded a few MP3 songs, which took 20 minutes each. I went back to purchasing CD's after that. Now that I have super high speed interenet at home, I figured that I could easily download the 2-3 good songs from an album instead of buying the whole CD. No way, thanks to something called the Cloud Player. Let me get this straight! If I purchase MP3 songs from Amazon, I am not even allowed to keep them on the hard drive of my desk top PC, which I now also use as a home juke box fed into my home stereo system. It now also seems like everyone assumes that everyone else has a smart phone and listens to music through ear buds. Well I DON'T! I listen to all of my MP3 files through 240 watts in my car or at home. I could not even find a way to contact Amazon to see if I am wrong, but from reading all of these negative reviews, it appears to be worse. Big Brother has now found a way to know your every move so all kinds of crap can be advertised to you without invitation. It looks like when CD's quit being made, my music buying days are over with.

A prime (har har) example is Dance & Electronic where everything is lumped into one. Sorry, but there's over a hundreds sub-genres of Electronic (let alone Dance) to just clump it together. Perhaps when Amazing becomes serious about music other people will take it more seriously as well."

I know there might be some legal issue, but one way is to convert it to amazon format when upload, with user confirmation of course.Looking forward to more use of cloud drive and cloud player!!!"

Unfortunately downloading from the cloud player to the local memory was non-functional. App only downloads to internal memory, and the media playing portion only plays media on external memory. Call to Amazon support only netted the advice: ""try calling your carrier"". Surprisingly enough Verizon doesn't employ anyone with an expertise in software written by Amazon, so I have a half-functional app. I supposed that would be worth 2.5 stars if it weren't for the support calls literally laughing me off the call."

There was no way to get around it. Then I paid for Amazon's mp3 cloud service. They didn't have an app for my iTouch but at least I could play the exact same tracks that I uploaded. When the Amazon app for the iTouch and iPhone came out, I was very happy because it worked well and it was easy to play all of the music that I uploaded. Now with this latest update to Amazon's cloud service, it's just like I'm back using iTunes match. A number of my mono tracks have been matched by Amazon and I'm getting the stereo version. I understand why match is available and get why it's a great tool but there really needs to be a way to bypass the match feature so people can listen to the exact mp3 they want to hear, not the one Amazon decides you should listen to. Some of the other tracks I've uploaded come from audiophile releases that sound much better than the ones offered by Amazon. So in these cases, I'm losing sound quality. Please, give us the option to shut off match if we don't want it."

I checked my memory card and every place on my phone that I thought I may retrieve it from to no avail.  I was very upset to say the least. I spent over $15.00 on those downloads and now I have them no longer and can not retrieve them from the amazon.com web page as there was not save to your computer option when ordering by my phone thru the amazon.com mp3 app.  I implore Amazon to correct this issue and at least have a notification worked into the program that will put up a note asking if you are sure that you want to delete this song, as it will no longer be available.  This is the only fair thing to do, anything else, leaves the customer to have to re-purchase the song download.  I look forward to Amazon making this change very soon and until then I will be making my purchases else where."

A couple tweaks and this would be my new default player. My biggest gripe is the lack of control from the lock screen. It takes way too many presses to skip a song- especially while driving. I wish holding the next/previous buttons would fast forward /rewind. My last complaint is needlessly specific, but I wish the widget showed cover art. The whole interface could be more exciting, but I don't mind the simplicity. The ability to store in the cloud is amazing, and it works great. That said, until I feel comfortable using it as my primary player, I won't have much use for it. I'm hoping amazon updates soon with the must-haves (and wouldn't hate to see the superficial stuff addressed either) Great start to what must be the future of how we listen to music!"

The cloud player service makes this the best thing to happen to music in a long. Now you can upload all your music to there website and have access to all your music without taking up space on your devices anymore. Also great if you like me always have to transfer song from multiple devices now you can just upload or buy from amazon have access to everything instantly from any device that can use the service. Android phone/tablet pc or MAC computer. So you get to keep your music forever unlike itunes one time purchase and goodlook with keep your music safe.

Right now, it does not seem to be capable of completely smooth streaming over a mobile connection (and Wi-Fi, some say).  Even more maddeningly, the app displays unpredictable behavior in the face of sound alerts on my Motorola Droid 1...playback will stop and not resume (with on-phone MP3s) or start randomly after an audio alert.  Fix these two issues, and it'd be a five-star app.Otherwise, Amazon did a fantastic job with the CloudPlayer!"

Rodenhauser","April 4, 2011",3,"I love the concept of a cloud drive, especially from my preferred vendor of MP3s, however the player/store needs a reworking. There are some performance issues which I'm sure they're working on since this is the initial launch, however my real gripes are with their overall approach to playing music from a their own remote source.Why must shopping/playing from cloud/playing locally feel like three completely separate tasks in one app? Instead of trying to jam two apps into one, and still giving the user that segregated feeling, give this app some synergy! I know that's pretty lame buzzword, but listen...The concept is simple at the high level:The user's list of tracks should be unification of what is online only, and what they have locally... NOT two separate lists. I'd like to see indicators of a track's source, but I should be able to make a playlist (or at least a track selection) that pulls from BOTH sources. This would actually save their bandwidth to pull from local storage whenever possible. Keep the ability to switch to ""offline"" mode, but it should not be the default, and it should NOT feel like a separate app/task/list. Much better user experience.On top of that, Amazon could sell much more music through the player by giving us the ability to sample music similar to our own library, or what we just listened to. They've got their ""similar customers"" logic down pretty good, why not put it right in the player? Don't force it on us, but offer it. As much flack as Apple gets for it's ""Genius"" lists, that stuff sells a lot of music. I would think this would be easy for Amazon.My last suggestion may be a pipe dream but for Android 2.2+ users, Amazon really should tie into the Voice Actions events. When I say ""Listen to Tool"" (or better yet, music I don't have) to my phone, the only apps on my phone that support that action are Pandora and Last.fm... Why not Amazon? If it's something I have, play it! If not, give me samples with the ability to quickly purchase. I think that could be a HUGE driver of sales.THINK ABOUT IT DEVELOPERS, THINK ABOUT IT!Lastly, as many other reviewers have said, app functionality dedicated solely to browsing for mp3's should be separate... or built into one of your other shopping apps, not into the player. I know you think that's gonna help sell music, but now I have to click extra times to get to the market because I normally use this app as a player, so I normally just wait till I'm at a computer, and sometimes I forget what I wanted to look for. Not an optimal experience for the user (or the salesman)!"

"13087","Amazon","Best on Android","Nocturnys","March 26, 2011",5,"This is absolutely the best mp3 app out there. The search function has never let me down in over 500 searches & downloads. The only critiques I have are that the app needs to include a Current list of top 50 for each category, in addition to aggregating compilation albums so they are listed as a single album after downloading instead of around 15 separate albums. Makes it kind of annoying when I want to listen to a soundtrack, and have to create a playlist to do so because the songs are not grouped together under one album."
"13088","Amazon","Perfect if you have Amazon Echo","fatgotti","July 10, 2017",3,"Great music service that is getting better and better but still has some ground to cover to catch up to a few others. But the plan if you have a echo is just amazing for the price"

Amazon MP3 Player was one of my favorite apps, but this new Music with Prime is total garbage in my opinion."
"13093","Amazon","Finally Useful!","J. Graves","April 3, 2011",5,"This app showed up on my Droid Incredible with the Froyo update.  I was furious!  I had never purchased a single song from Amazon, yet here's this app for them that I couldn't remove?  My opinion changed with the introduction of the Amazon Cloud Drive and Player.  I bought my first Amazon album to get the free $20 worth of storage space and started to upload all of my music to the Cloud.  Be patient.  It takes a long time (about 4 days, for me) to upload my songs.The app works just fine.  It is easy to create/delete/edit playlists.  The store portion is easy as well.  It even shows the free song of the day!  I haven't had any problems with playback, either.  My only suggestion to make this better is to have several widget options.  I want one that is full screen and displays the album art of the current song."

I now have about 90% of my music collection in Amazon Cloud. The player and streaming service are nice. However, the downfall of this app is the inability to store media and data on the SD card. Recent Android phones have a tiny amount of internal storage, especially after carriers add their apps. Amazon MP3 adds to the persistent headache by not taking advantage of external storage."
"13108","Amazon","Amazing!!","Davidthomp","April 1, 2011",5,"I love this player. Works great on 3g use it on the drive home to and from work with no problems. 20 gigs if you buy an album off of mp3 store how can you wrong. That is for a year and then 20 bucks a year after that.

The player is playing, as it shows the track progressing, but no sound is produced.

The search tool works well.  The playlists they have compiled actually match the subject/genre.  Unlike other apps, where there always seemed to be random songs within the playlist that don't belong, each song fits.  The selection is huge, I have only found a few artists/albums that weren't available, or were limited to the unlimited version.  All in all it is a very good music app, and I highly recommend it."

AmazonMP3 insists on downloading your music to sdcard/ and has no option to download to sdcard-ext/.  I have a 32GB microSD card that I want to download my music to, but this app has no option to do that.  Instead it downloads to the internal memory.

I realize amazon probably wants people using the cloud storage and streaming for whatever dumb reason, but unfortunately for me i suppose, I want to actually have the music I paid for without having to log into a service to use it. Total BS imo.This is why people fileshare...five albums would have been done and moved onto my phone by now so I can leave, but instead I guess I'll be here another half an hour.Also, this downloader just sucks. It keeps popping up windows media player every time a) the current song it is struggling to download has finished and then b) when the new song being prepared to download actually starts to download. I can't minimize the program permanently to keep the window down, and I can't close it because it immediately restarts itself, so the other screens I'm looking at keep getting interrupted. Worst program ever. I have no idea why this ridiculous, buggy-acting, painfully slow app is necessary to get the files onto my computer.

"13777","Amazon","Keeps auto launching","Jerry","September 28, 2017",3,"Since the last update, the Android Amazon Music app keeps auto launching the player in my status bar.  I can't figure how to shut that feature off or stop that.  It just gets really annoying."
"13778","Amazon","UPDATE:  FIXED (was ""A music player that can't play music.  Seriously?"")","RichFDrums","March 31, 2011",3,"UPDATE - ATTENTION EVO 4G USERS:  It turns out (after much online research today) that the issues I was experiencing were unique to the HTC Evo 4G, and were the result of a software update that had been pushed out to Evo users earlier this year.  Apparently this update had changed HTTP and RTSP streaming settings/configuration in a way that affected certain apps--in this case it rendered the Amazon cloud player completely useless.Interestingly, Pandora was somehow never affected by it, and so I hadn't noticed the problem until now.  Go figure.Anyway, the issue can easily be resolved by contacting Sprint Technical Support (1-888-211-4727) and asking the rep to apply the work around listed as 'HTC EVO 4G (A9292) - UPDATED 2-1-2011: Streaming multimedia applications receiving errors on software version 3.70.651.1' in Sprint's device portal.  I did this, and when I finally got to a tech support rep, he immediately knew what I was talking about, pushed an over-the-air fix, and 5 minutes later I was streaming from the Amazon mp3 cloud (over 3G) without any issues at all.It works perfectly now.  Sweet.  I'm upgrading my rating from 1 star (when I really meant 0) to 3 stars.---- previous review -----:This review is specific to the new ""cloud player"" functionality of the app.  Two words:  utterly useless.  I would honestly give it 0 stars if I could.I'm on an HTC Evo (Android 2.2).  Regardless of my connection--WiFi, 4G, 3G--I continually get the same ""Network Error"" when trying to play anything at all in the app.  It just doesn't work.  All other network-dependent apps on my device are working perfectly fine, while the Amazon MP3 player fails.I wouldn't even consider this alpha-quality software.  Did this thing even go through QA at all?"
"13779","Amazon","junk","Jay","March 28, 2011",1,"bloatware junk on my EVO soaks up memory, something like this should only run when you use it.don't get it, besides there are so many apps that don't run in the background out in the world that you can listen to or download music from."
"13780","Amazon","love it","YankeeM","May 22, 2011",5,"love it hands down. being able to have my music anywhere without eating up space on my sd card. also not having to fumble with syncing with the pc is a plus"
"13781","Amazon","Can't download what I purchased previously","Brandon E. Barker","March 26, 2011",1,"This is a big enough problem to cause the application to have a one star rating; Amazon should be able to fix such an issue. Look to google music to rescue us."
"13782","Amazon","works great on my lg optimus","DJ","May 14, 2011",5,"I love this app. It works exactly like it should. It's easy to buy music and to download songs from the cloud drive to my phone. It's also fast and there's like zero load time at all. Once I get all my music on the cloud drive I'll probably use this more than my iPod."
"13783","Amazon","Forced to have this program","Daniel R Colestock","June 2, 2011",1,"This program came instalked by default on my evo 4g with no way to remove it.  At least give us a way to remove it so the people who don't want it can take it off.  What is the point in not giving us a remove option?"
"13784","Amazon","Amazon Music Could Be Better","Mr. Ng","June 15, 2017",3,"I do like the app, however, it has a major glitch which is really annoying.  The app requires an Internet connection to play your music even it is already downloaded to your device.  How it comes?  This is a simple function that can be controlled in the code."
"13785","Amazon","Quite redundant","PenName","May 25, 2017",1,"This app is awkward and a total nuisance. And it will not upload to my LG Stylus 2 which is a brand new phone I just got from Stream Mobile. All other Amazon Apps work but this one! Bring back the original app please."
"13786","Amazon","Amazon MP3 hindered my 911 call for emergency help","jbru","April 16, 2012",1,"I would give this application 0 stars if that were possible.  It came with my Sprint phone and presumably Amazon paid Sprint so that customers couldn't remove the application.That's fine, I just never used it.  I never bought anything, I never browsed anything, I never even opened the application.Of course, that didn't stop this worthless excuse for a piece of software from downloading random updates whenever the hell it wanted; like when I was trying to do other things with the phone.  It also had a fun little feature (re: bug) where it would use 100% of the phone's processor for minutes on end.  I say minutes because it would often run down the battery life on my phone.  I would, randomly throughout the week, find that my phone had turned itself off due to low battery power.Again, mind you, I had never opened or used the application.I endured all of this with quiet patience because while it was definitely an inconvenience, I was busy and it wasn't *that* big of an inconvenience.Then then time came when I was driving and tragically, a car in front of me struck a pedestrian.  I pulled my car over in the road to block traffic from become a danger to the injured kid who was lying in the road with a compound fracture in his right leg (it looked like his leg had nearly come off), scrapes, contusions, broken teeth, and most likely a nasty concussion.  The people driving the car that had struck the person got out and started freaking out.  They stood around looking panic'd without a sense of direction.  I got out of my car and dialed 911, spotted a street address posted on a nearby building, and ran over to the kid to see how bad it was.Meanwhile, my phone stalled and I waited, and waited, and waited.  For 2 minutes and 14 seconds I waited for my phone to call 911 while I slowly started to freak out thinking I wasn't going to be able to get help for this kid.In the end I did get through and managed to speak to 911 personnel, get advised on what to do for the kid, and made sure that the people freaking out didn't move him (neck injuries people, neck injuries).But for an extra 2 minutes and 14 seconds this poor kid had to lie in the street in pain saying ""I just want to go home"" over and over again.Later, after I got off the phone with emergency personnel, I looked in my phone's task monitor and histories to find out why it had taken so long to call.  As it turns there happened to be an application that I had never used that was, for reasons unknown, using 100% of the phone's processing power.Tell me, readers, which application do you suppose that was?  Go on, guess.Now some of you will say that I should have rooted my phone earlier to remove the app.  I know right?  Some people actually think that it should have been necessary for me to break my phone and change settings, voiding my warranty, so that I could call emergency services in a timely fashion.Amazon MP3 was forced on me.  I have never used Amazon MP3.  I WILL NEVER use Amazon MP3 after that."

"13788","Amazon","No support for Boost's Motorola i1 running Android 1.5","Todd A. Jacobs","March 30, 2011",1,"Since Boost Mobile only supports a single Android phone at this time, the inability to run apps on a platform that Amazon says they support is inexcusable."
"13789","Amazon","Once was good, now is bad!!!","amy","June 14, 2017",1,"I was considering upgrading, but now, no way. For some reason the app will play some songs and not others on my play list. I contacted support and all they could suggest was reinstalling the app, which I did with no result.  Even off line my play list will only play some of my songs, but not others that it once played. Very DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!"
"13790","Amazon","when will it open to people outside the states?","Leung Hoi Tung","March 23, 2011",1,"people outside the states can buy books, cd, but no mp3, why? i hope this app will soon be available to non american music lover like me."
