"2","iHeartRadio","Good but Frequently Malfunctions","Thrisha Nesbitt","April 11, 2014",3,"This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."

"4","iHeartRadio","weird mix sometimes","didisparkles","September 21, 2013",4,"Love the commercial free app. Sometimes there is a 30 second ad at the beginning then that's it for hours. I don't like that you can only skip so many times a day because sometimes there is some really horrid stuff."

"8","iHeartRadio","love it","Forgiven","June 5, 2015",4,"Pick stations, artists or songs and hit play it's that easy. Plus it remembers what u like and plays similar stuff!!"
"9","iHeartRadio","Great App","Skyler","October 27, 2015",5,"Excellent app! Works well, and streams well even in the background with other apps running. Love the customization that it offers. The app learns what music u actually like through your ratings. So rate what you like, and the stations will cater well to you."
"10","iHeartRadio","would be great","I. OLeary","April 30, 2013",4,"i loved this app at first especially after switching from pandora to this it seemed to have all the same functions plus you could stream internet stations as well but after a while i noticed some songs are censored. there is a setting for explicit content but it just keeps you from using custom stations other than that its a pretty great replacement for pandora and its FREE WITH NO LIMITS!!! ALSO YOU DONT NEED FACEBOOK.i dont have it and i have saved custom stations"
"11","iHeartRadio","Four Stars","Ralph","July 24, 2017",4,"Great Radio app. Just wish I could get local ball games."

"13","iHeartRadio","Five Stars","Michael DiDonato","January 7, 2017",5,"love it"
"14","iHeartRadio","Not impressed.","terrbearr","March 14, 2015",3,"Not a real big fan of this app.  If I want commercials I can listen to the radio in my car. The way everyone talked about it, I had to try it. Maybe I just haven't found the right radio station(s)"
"15","iHeartRadio","Nice option","Tom","December 2, 2015",5,"Work's well! Good variety of stations, and styles of music. I can turn on whatever kind of programming that I'm in the mood for and not have to listen to whatever automated crap that the record labels and station owners decide is popular!"

"17","iHeartRadio","radio worth listening to","Sam Crawford","January 21, 2013",5,"What makes iHeart Radio worth while is that you can listen to regular radio stations, or you can creat your own station. I find myself listening to stations in other parts of the USA.  Creating your own personal station is what I like best about this app. so many stations only play what they are dictated to play, it is nice to listen to stations where the music is understandable. If you like music, and are not happy with the local stations, this is the app for you."
"18","iHeartRadio","Good when it works!!!","Pam Schott","January 3, 2014",2,"I think that the application was great at first but then it started freezing.When ever I go on it and try to change the music,it says that it is not responding and to wait or close it! I love the app but it is not not behaving.I have tried downloading the app many times but it still won't work on my kindle fire.It is making me very frustrated.If you want to listen to music,DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!"
"19","iHeartRadio","Bugged alarm?","Ian L.","April 22, 2015",4,"Easily my most used app. Great selection with variety when I need it. Only problem I run into is the alarm that rarely works. Bringing up a message that it failed to go off because the app was not running when it clearly was. Leading me to use a fail-safe so I make it to my appointments."

"21","iHeartRadio","iHeartRadio free music app review","spammy0124","December 13, 2016",5,"This is a great app, especially on the stereo FireHD 8"" tablet. Setup your channels and let it go. Hear what you want at any time you want."
"22","iHeartRadio","iHeartRadio Review","MSquat","March 19, 2013",5,"After hearing countless radio stations saying that they are part of iHeartRadio, I figured I'd download the app to my Kindle Fire HD and see what it's all about.  I have to tell you, I was very surprised at the amount of stations associated with the network and the quality of the audio.  I'm going to purchase a Bose Bluetooth wireless speaker and now I can stream radio stations to it as well because of the app.  And, it was free, so how can you go wrong?"

"25","iHeartRadio","One of my daily use apps!","Mike","December 3, 2013",5,"I use this app on a daily basis for radio at home.  I live in an area that has poor radio reception on all radios in my home.  No problems in my vehicles but reception sucks in the house.  This app allows me to have a huge variety of stations from the internet via Wi-Fi.  The clarity of the music stream is awesome and it is highly customizable with favorites. I really like this app and recommend it"
"26","iHeartRadio","Five Stars","Amazon Customer","July 25, 2017",5,"Ticket 760. The Mike Taylor Show. The Grind. Fox Sports."
"27","iHeartRadio","Great music choices!","P. Belfy","July 27, 2014",5,"I love a very broad spectrum of music. This app does a great job of anticipating music I will like based on music I have requested or liked. The is a fine tune option for more familiar or less. Also the opportunity to find terrestrial radio stations. Nice mix. My go-to for music and talk for my every mood.Mountain Goat are the best!"
"28","iHeartRadio","Music Lover","RonP","April 12, 2013",5,"This is the best station in the music business. If you want variety and love all kind of music this is for you. It works great on my Kindle Fire."
"29","iHeartRadio","it is easy to use and too associate by genre or artist","Ronald Nelson","February 27, 2016",5,"Absolutely free... this program provides access to thousands of US radio stations... it is easy to use and too associate by genre or artist.

"31","iHeartRadio","Love it! love it!","chatcat65","January 9, 2014",5,"App is fabulous letting you access with or without Facebook or email just like it says. Easy to use and navigate through setting up your own stations or selecting ones nationwide and easily located.  I set up my own stations based on my likes/dislikes especially because I'm super picky and like radically different channels depending on the mood at the moment. Thanks for the great freebie!"

"36","iHeartRadio","Generally good music","luvinthislife","May 30, 2015",4,"I enjoy the app, but just wish it contained more episodes of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 countdown. Also, some of the ""classics"" stations (pop, country, rock, soul, etc.) don't actually contain music from the genre they are supposed to, which can be an annoyance."
"37","iHeartRadio","Good Shit","KuShNuGsS611","September 21, 2013",5,"A good radio player no doubt! Especially for those times when you get out of your car when ur favorite song was on and u wanna keep listening to it but got no radio handy, you just click ur station on here and the same song will be playing everytime! You can also create your own personal stations, and use any station for an alarm clock music wake up, and more... Overall Good App!! And best of all its FREEE!!!"
"38","iHeartRadio","No way to stop the music","Walter J Bermudez","December 5, 2012",2,"This is a good App,but I have two mayor complaints:first,I selected some type of music and selected one broadcasting of the same one,and it never sound.It looks like non existent,so this is something very annoing;second,once you are done hearing the music there is no way to turn off the site,you have to turn off the ,in my case,the kindle Fire.Also,wrong.Usually I try to hear music at the same time I am reading,so I have to turno off the whole sistem,not just the App."
"39","iHeartRadio","update and inappropriate.","Fernandez","February 24, 2015",3,"I don't really like the app because it has some inappropriate pictures of some singers.Also when I had  full Internet connection it would not turn on.I like the app because it has alot of my favorite songs.But when I press a song I want to play it just picks different song.So I rate it 3 stars."
"40","iHeartRadio","Can listen to my favorite morning show","Renee","November 7, 2014",4,"I started using the iHeartRadio app when I could not listen to the radio at my new job. I loved being able to listen to the radio without interference. The only problem I have had is that at least once a month, I cannot hear the radio from my favorite station because it will not connect. Otherwise, this app is great!"
"41","iHeartRadio","Probably the best radio app...","Thomas from NC","June 12, 2014",5,"Great variety of live stations, music of every description as well as news/talk and sports! A large library of artists and their catalogs as well for customized stations, made from song titles or the artist's/group's nam. Even has stations for activities like studying, working out, or relaxing. It also has stations for the different decades of music."
"42","iHeartRadio","AMAZING!","Maryellen E","March 19, 2015",5,"I used to use this app all the time.

"44","iHeartRadio","NOTE II","Ralph","March 10, 2014",5,"This is a fantastic App. It's smooth. It offers great mixes of your Genre or specific Artists. It also offers local radio Stations in your area as well. If you purchase the Premium Version, it will allow you to record the songs you like as well. I don't ever recommend anything I don't or wouldn't use. I don't believe you will be disappointed. I highly recommend this one."
"45","iHeartRadio","I love I Heart Radio","Rose Duran","January 3, 2017",5,"I love I Heart Radio, can hear all my favorite music, don't use the radio that much why when I have I heart Radio, Thanks I Heart Radio"
"46","iHeartRadio","eh... it's OK","Johnny in Texas","December 14, 2015",3,"It's clear channel... just be aware those people have an agenda.  BUT you get about the same quality as any radio station except you get to choose the format (although not the content...  like I said ... CCC has an agenda)."
"47","iHeartRadio","I AM IN LOVE","Lori Wise Scheirer","August 4, 2013",5,"I have been listening since they were available.

"48","iHeartRadio","Great!","C. Ligh","December 23, 2012",5,"This is a great app.  I put it on my kindle fire and was able to put in my zip code and find my local stations.  I was also able to put in the local station that is playing just Christmas songs.  Then, the grandchildren were able to hit ""scan"" and go through all the stations just playing holiday songs.  By myself, I just put my favorite local station in while I was cleaning the house.  Another cleaning day today.  Looking forward to listen to the radio!"

"58","iHeartRadio","I suppose","Yoshiyah Burrell","May 28, 2015",2,"But I prefer to just listen to music files locally as I don't like listening to hit music. I use it for streaming news and sports on the go though. iHeartRadio app also doesn't offer every station available in your area. Just the ones that are licensed by ClearChannel."

I heart radio app is the best thing that has ever been created"
"61","iHeartRadio","Won't connect with Facebook","Darrin Bond","May 9, 2012",2,"It's funny how the Amazon version of this app won' t connect using Facebook, but the Google Play version will.This isn't the first time I've seen differences in the offerings of the two app stores. Unfortunately, it tends to be Amazon that falls short of the mark. For those of you with Kindle Fire that might be interested in Google Play apps, I would suggest finding out how to ""sideload"" the apps. It's not difficult, and it gives you another - and sometimes better - app source."
"62","iHeartRadio","loveee","brother","June 30, 2014",5,"I love this app because I can listen to all my favorite songs. I am a DIRECTIONER. So I can listen to ONE DIRECTION when I want. U can also listen to other people to tho. Another awesome thing about this app is that u can listen to the radio. Like kiss FM.

"63","iHeartRadio","Songza, Pandora, and live radio all in one!!","David","June 21, 2013",5,"This app is like all major radio apps in one, and that's why i love it! Its kind of like Songza with the Perfect For feature. If its Friday afternoon, click perfect for and it will give you things like working, napping, etc. Click one and start listening. Its also like pandora in which you type in an artist or song, and itll give you similar ones. and of course, it has the live radio stations its known for. Get this app."
"64","iHeartRadio","NOT IMPRESSED","Tina Marie Bailey","August 18, 2015",2,"I do not care for I heart for my phone.  Difficult to find what type of music I want to listen ((such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, 80's music just to name a few)) or the selection available is too limited.  I would NOT recommend this product."
"65","iHeartRadio","Five Stars","Amadeo Molinos","May 4, 2017",5,"Best app ever. Use it all the time."

"68","iHeartRadio","great app!!","Jaydlyn Frank","July 10, 2014",5,"I love this app honestly. It's a great alarm. And sleep timer. Also the music is amazing. I'm in a different state, and now I can listen to my music from back home. But I think they should add a extra thing to where we can make a playlist of songs and be able to go to that sometimes. But I hope you take this to heart. Rate five for sure."
"69","iHeartRadio","Best radio app!","DIGItal Don","January 2, 2017",5,"Hands down my favorite radio app! Very easy to create custom station. Also integrates very nicely with Amazon music for purchases."

"71","iHeartRadio","Core engine works great, finding/tuning stations not so great","Michael S. Pukish","January 30, 2014",3,"The core engine works great, never skips, even with relatively low bandwidth connections.  However, I hate that it forces you to link to facebook or twitter just to bookmark stations as favorite.  I have no need to tell all of my social media what I'm listening to.  Then, the system that's left to merely search a station is clunky, inefficient (huge icons per screen), etc."
"72","iHeartRadio","Three Stars","Bran di    POsey","July 12, 2015",3,"Good"
"73","iHeartRadio","Great For Music Lovers","Ted Harden","October 29, 2015",4,"Anyone who likes music will like this app. Lots of similarities with other apps of this type but without the pesky ads.

"75","iHeartRadio","Great way to listen to music","Deb S","September 22, 2013",4,"Have seen commercials on TV for iHeartRadio and wanted to see what it was about...don't have it locally. This app gave me the chance to check it out. You can select the type of music you want to listen to, and locations for your stations. I just wish some of them were closer to where I live.Pros: great music choices to your likingCons: may not be a station near you.Highly recommend"
"76","iHeartRadio","I will always enjoy old school music","Karen L.Clarke","February 29, 2016",5,"I will always enjoy old school music. I like making my radio station. But what I like the most is, I  can read the words of my favorite  songs  I Heart please keep up the good work.  Thank you."

"80","iHeartRadio","Its nice!!","James Burcham","October 12, 2014",5,"I love this app. I would probably die without my music. And don't listen to the people who say it don't work without Facebook. You can still use it you just can't get custom stations. And if you are really desperate for some custom stations, just go to email and make a fake one. It will let you get custom stations."
"81","iHeartRadio","üé∂MUSICüé∂","Shukumei","May 10, 2015",5,"If you love music this is for you. Top artist from Ariana to Wizfliffia. The only thing I hate is that if you don't have an account for it you can't listen to stations that have all Taylor swift. However, you can still listen to music even if you don't have an account."
"82","iHeartRadio","I Heart IHeartRadio!","Abby","August 6, 2012",4,"I normally don't write reviews but I decided,  why not? Personally, I love the app! It is great to hear songs from some of my favorite radio stations and even find new artists. I have found two new radio stations because of this app. It is easy to use, free and works great on my Kindle Fire (in which, I use it every day). The only thing is I wish it had the ""last songs listened to"" feature like the website has. Other than that I think the app is all around great for what it does."
"83","iHeartRadio","Seamless and accurate","rod clark","February 25, 2014",4,"I love this app. Iheart is perhaps not as diverse as others, but i don't care. Too many people think they need to be bleeding edge music hipsters; sometimes i just wanna hear Justin, Imagine Dragons and Jay-Z. You don't need, to hide, people. Be happily lazy, let a sophisticated algorithm(misspelled?) pick your music. If you don't like the pick, skip it! FREEDOM!!!"
"84","iHeartRadio","The best entertainment.","Jgaski3","March 29, 2016",5,"Thousands of stations to choose from and a perfect way to kill time through out the work day. I installed this on my blackberry z30 and it worked perfectly and provided hours of entertainment"

"86","iHeartRadio","Minimally useful.","Kindle Customer","July 29, 2016",1,"It makes ""recommendations"" that have NOTHING to do with my likes,and then assigns some of those as ""favorites"" without letting me get rid of them."
"87","iHeartRadio","get this app","hannah","June 5, 2015",5,"This app is so amazing. You can listen to pretty much every song. This app is free and the music is free. You can also listen to the song while you play games or when on pinterest. Which is amazing but I highly recommend this to everyone if you want a music app."

"91","iHeartRadio","Love, Love, Love this App","Anna J. Warrington","February 27, 2015",5,"This is the best music app.  I have picked so many favorite stations, artists, and songs.  Sometimes you just want to hear a certain artist and you can listen to the songs from that artist.  Thanks for such a pleasant listening experience.  If you love music, this is the app for you."
"92","iHeartRadio","Best telephone radio ap so far.","Chrisbuyer","May 8, 2016",5,"I heart iHeartRadio. On a recent trip across country, where the Tunin app would skip and drop out, iHeartRadio played cleanly through with no drops and no problems finding stations."

What I found was an app that allows streaming, but only through a limited amount of stations (5). This may be due to my area or it may not. Good news is it's free so give it a shot and see if it works better for you."

All u need to do is go to the website on the computer to create an account so u can have special stations instead of the regular ones or u can just skip the Facebook log in thing for just regular stations just like a normal radio. It is way better then Pandora in my opinion cause u get to have regular stations plus the custom ones  u make. Definitely worth downloading :)"

It is easy to use and easy to save your favorite stations. My only gripe is in the custom stations you setup for yourself (Pandora style). The songs they play on these I sometimes really hate. It's not necessarily that it is in the wrong genre but the song is just terrible. Cut the crap music out and it would be much better."
"444","iHeartRadio","Amazing music app!","Denelle Peterson","October 19, 2013",5,"This app is perfect for your kindle fire when reading a book.First, I am a huge fan of Taylor Swift.

Definitely a keeper the only reason I do not give it a five star is because it does not have a timer that can turn it off like Songza and Pandora has better sound quality options."

Also I need to point out that you do NOT need facebook to sign up or in. It is an option ONLY!

The latest versions do not allow the user to save favorite stations unless they have a facebook account, which I do not. The prior versions allowed this, which is obviously a timesaver so as not to have to go searching through multiple cities and stations to get to the ones I wish to listen.

"702","iHeartRadio","Better than Pandora!","aanimec15","February 12, 2015",5,"I love this app! I use it all the time both on the computer and on my Kindle Fire. There are so many things I like about it but it's better to start somewhere simple. In Pandora, when you're first starting out and you want to make your own station, you can't just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not, it's going to show you other songs instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you wanted to listen to and THEN it'll give you different songs that are similar to the one you listened to. Also another feature I really liked was the fact that you can listed to either songs familiar to your usual songs or songs that are completely different. This a great feature for people trying to figure out their taste in music.I think that the most important feature is NO COMMERCIALS! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see is in the beginning and that's it. Mind you I'm not paying or anything like that for no commercials. I could go on and on about this app but I think it's best to stop here and let you experience and play around with the app yourself."
"703","iHeartRadio","It's Okay..I Expected Better","RTD","October 26, 2014",3,"Alot of hurdles in the set up process.

But why on earth does this need to know where you are within a 5' radius?  It can easily determine which ads you should receive and which stations you are allowed to listen to by using COARSE location data.  It doesn't need GPS precision for anything other than to sell that information to whomever is interested in buying it.It runs at startup, running constantly in the background tracking your every movement even if you aren't listening to it.  Why?Plus, it gets your list of accounts on your device. All of them. Does Clear Channel need to know about all of your accounts on your Android?  If so, for what reasons?It's sickening what this app does, for no apparent reason other than to sell your personal, confidential accounts and location information."

It has memory leak issues. It throws up stupid ads that mean one wrong touch and it's changing stations. It someone thinks it's lost it's connection. All sorts of BS.They tout it as popular. This app sucks. It's only popular because it's the only way to listen to some stations online.Rather than compete and make a better mobile radio product, they chose to be jerks and make a crappy one and not let anyone compete.Install it if these dolts bought one of the stations you like to listen to. It is or soon will be the only way to listen to them on your mobile device.  Prepare to be tracked and force fed ads, too.This is not a app written for a great user experience. This is an app written to track you and what you listen to and to make more ad revenue for these idiots at ClearChannel and Cumulus.  They're strategy is seems is to acquire stations with good content, micromanage that content so it's not as good as it was before, and then play gatekeeper with how to listen to it and force you into a sub par, feature poor, privacy exploiting, profit high experience."

I never have to miss a minute of my beloved early morning show, because not only can I listen to it streaming live through IHeart, but I can also listen to it on demand! It doesn't stop there, either! Oh no, you can create all the stations you want, categorized in a million ways! Create a station by typing in your favorite band and IHeart will play you all that bands most popular songs along with the greatest hits by bands of a similar genre. You have a thumbs up and down to rate every song IHeart plays for you and it remembers. You can even create your own personal station by choosing ""your favorites"". It will play all the songs you've rated with a thumbs up. This is by far the coolest app for any music maniac! And it's free!! So how can you go wrong??

CHEAT!","MamaGonsalves916","June 21, 2013",4,"I'm glad I read the reviews of this app.  It looks like the only major complaint is the FB for certain functionality.  I have a FB account and get annoyed when I see popup notices that my old Highschool acquaintance is ""currently listening to Paranoid by Megadeth"", you get my drift, and I hope that won't happen to me if when I sign up.  I'm not sure if linking the iHeart Radio to my FB will do that and I also don't want to find out the hard way.  This is also EXTREME social media and somewhere in the fine print of that legal jargon nobody fully reads, they may (probably) get your authorization to access your contacts and more. My answer to this possible dilemma is, create a ghost FB account.  I have backed out of a few cool apps in the recent past because they have required FB, it's about time I conform to the masses, but not let them win :-)  So go ahead and enjoy this app and don't worry about the FB aspect, just cheat."

"5543","iHeartRadio","Good Clean Reception","James","August 17, 2013",4,"I was looking for an app that could deliver streamed radio from various locations.  I live in an area where there is only garbage talk radio and no other type.  I've found stations through the internet on my home computer, but wasn't able to enjoy it at work.  Enter iHeart.  At first it was a little buggy, dropping and the stream would cut out, but with recent updates, they seem to have solved the problem.  Also, I am running a Galaxy S3 with 4G and it does make a difference.  The cell reception at work was only showing 3G and is now showing 4G and I rarely experience interruptions. I don't mind the start up advertisement, hey a company's got to make a living. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is when I am traveling, the buffer isn't large enough to allow for tower hand-off and when you're driving it can get annoying to have your program cut out a lot. Fix that, and I can give it a fifth star."

After two weeks I still haven't found anything I like, and I don't know how to get past all the pop stations. If I wanted to listen to my 3 local pop stations and the local rock station I would turn on my damn radio. I wanted stations from everywhere, I'm sorry but the classic rock station in Texas is the same as the station in New Jersey. I feel that this app is for people who are so glued to their phones they can't be bothered to reach over and turn on the radio.  Hey if you like it that's fine, this app is not for me.  On another note I downloaded Tune-in radio and that app literally solved every problem I had with iHeartRadio in about 2 seconds."

It's nice to be able to listen to my local radio stations and I also enjoy the ""create your own station"" feature. It's cool to be able to hear music I like with the element of surprise you get from radio because you don't know what's coming on next. All with very few commercials.What I don't like is that the ""create your own station"" feature isn't as attuned to feedback as it leads you to believe. When you skip or ""thumbs down"" an artist multiple times, on some stations you never hear that artist again, but on others you'll hear the artist again in a few minutes, and every time you listen to that station."

I went online to listen to my favorite morning show while I got ready for work. Well that never happened cause apparently I have to sign up for iHeartRadio in order to do this. This has not been the case for many years of my listening enjoyment. Needless to say, I never heard the morning show or anything else, because instead of making myself late for work and wasting time signing up for this crap I got ready in silence and got to work on time. I think it is sad that this is what our world has come to. We can't just enjoy what the internet has to offer without giving our entire identity and personal information so that I can repeatedly receive emails asking ""how are we doing"" on an app I haven't had the time or patients to try to figure out how the stupid thing even works. I deleted this app from my devices since it does me no good and just takes up space."

This is not what I would call listening to my local station.

"11361","iHeartRadio","Would not let me listen","Monica M.","August 8, 2016",1,"I tried to create an account, but it would not let me because they do not service my country (currently on vacation in Turkey). This should not matter if I have an internet connection as the point of this app is to listen to radio over the internet. When my account creation failed, I continued into the app without one. Here I was given a good selection of stations, but the only one I was allowed to listen to was a Russian news station."
"11362","iHeartRadio","Pure streaming, but privacy invasion","Romans 1:16","April 18, 2016",3,"The app is very good as far as connection goes, but issues with privacy. Today, most apps don't charge you, but either gets personal information or relies on you buying in-app items instead. This app allows you to choose any station, by picking a genre, then selecting a station within that genre. All together, it's a great app, but it requires a lot of private info. I would recommend blocking your private info. when this app is installed, which should block information that this app can receive. You can delete the app to get to that information back, and then block and re-install the app. This app requires e-mail, so if you don't have one, create a fake e-mail for ads."

Took me a minute to start creating a custom station which brings me to my only disappointment so far, repetition.  While it's great that it looks for similar genre, one would think that with a db of 14M songs you wouldn't hear the same stuff within the first half-hour.  Overall? It's a keeper for me for now.  BIG BONUS - No ads every 2 minutes (or at all) unlike that other app.02-2013 UpdateHaven't used for quite some time. I'm all about TuneIn Radio these days. Stations from all over the world. If you can't find a genre to suit your mood, you're just not looking."

Iheart thinks that people like me do not exist so you can not go back to the song you just listened to and like or dislike it. You have to wait for the song to come up again or pray it doesn't and never have to hear it again.  If you don't like or dislike Iheart thinks you liked it or something like that, but everything else is perfect. I would not change anything else about it if you like music, radio, or lyrics strung along in a catchy tone this is the app for you."

Bored with radio station choices that were available, I played with my android phone and took advantage of the strong Wi-Fi signal at the outlet. I downloaded the iHeartRadio app and was pleasantly surprised. Music stations that I never heard of from distant locations all over the USA were at my fingertips. Talk readio, Classic Rock stations, Hip Hop, Oldies, Jazz. You name it, you can find it. What a great app!"

Our girls can only listen to the app when either my wife or I are present.  Thankfully we have that rule because some song came on with all sorts of profanity, that should not have been included in the Justin Bieber genre.  Dropped Pandora for the same reason.  I don't know why all these artists feel they need to have vulgar lyrics in good songs.  I am as far from ""prude"" as one can imagine, but if there is a chance that kids may hear it, it should not be played on this app."

My complaint is if I enter Charlie Daniels still in Saigon this song should come first on play list. My likes are vast from country to rap to heavy metal. This is better then trying to find music I like on the radio in the near southern border of michigan. No static on songs. No pay three dollars for a song. They need to add songs from movies. I rate this two and a half stars. They make it learn my diverse taste and make it with the little adjusting I will rate four or five stars today first day so may improve as I select music."

It features a sleep timer if you like to listen to music before bed, and an alarm to wake up to. However, if you are like me the music isn't enough to wake me up. You don't even have to be in the app to listen to the music. It is also good for finding new stations. It is completely free, and it's not required to sign in. If you love music as much as I do you should get this app."

When Pandora reduced free listening to 40 hrs a month I started looking for a replacement, and found one with IHeart radio.I have this app rocking on all my gadgets now (PC, tablet, ipod).The 'custom' personalized station function setting is very easy to use and the selection of artist-related songs is great.I rate songs while listening so IHeart radio learns to play more of the tunes I like. Also important is giving a 'Thumbs Down' to songs I don't want in the mix.So far I haven't heard any sound lag/buffering or annoying ads (Pandora has gotten bad with this in my experience).IHeart radio is highly recommended. Great accessibility, easy set-up and use, and unlimited FREE listening."

I like to use it on my Kindle too, but once it is launched and playing I cannot get the app back up. Music plays but the screen is blank. At first I thought it was because I had used another app and tried to come back to it, which seemed logical if a bit 2009. However it doesn't really matter, once the music is started the only way for it to stop is when it times out or I shut my kindle all the way down. No liking or disliking songs, no changing stations, or even knowing who the current artist is. Is anyone having problems like this? I make do but I'd love an update to fix this.The good news is it is stuck on a custom station made from my favorite band. That's something at least."

Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

"11848","iHeartRadio","Four Stars: Please read information below","Lyndah Ghostbear","April 24, 2017",4,"Way better than Spotify or Pandora. It has the current trending songs and stations! You could even create a playlist of all your favorite songs. Its free and there's no adds, so you could listen with no interruption from adds. All you need to do is like or dislike a song then it'll automatically choose songs or stations to play next. It'll also automatically recommend stations for you to listen to.I highly recommend it, the only thing is I wish I could travel and be on this app without paying any money. Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app, when you bring the menu up or down, you can't like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can't save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist.  This app is great all in all. Nothings perfect though and no one could ever make life that way. I think that this app may even receive a 4.5. And if you don't like it, remember its free and could be uninstalled. A little blunt but that's the truth. I'm here for the same thing as you, to maybe see if its worth it, to create a review or to expose. But here...There's nothing really to expose."

Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs.  You can touch a button if a song plays that you don't like and it will deleted from the playlist.  Like the song?  Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format.  As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state, being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app.  I have not had that problem.  I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen.  Just pick one and enjoy.

I spend far more time listening to this app than I do the radio anymore.  Very few ads really, just occasionally when I change stations.  Limited number of skips available per day, but meh, just change the station if you really can't stand that song.Now for the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  This is an older version 5.  The newer version 7 allows you to have a custom station of your favorites that you have rated.  This version is buggy or it just doesn't work because it will not load at all on my Kindle Fire.

"11933","iHeartRadio","Fantastic, and Much Better than Pandora!","Alison G.","August 24, 2015",5,"I was told to try iHeart Radio once Pandora started being a butthead. While Pandora is great, it started randomly shutting off on my phone, can take forever to load one song, or have an ad literally every other song. So I tried iHeart Radio. Why not? It's free. And man, am I glad I did! You can make your own station just from saying what one song you like, which is what I wanted, and you can tell it whether you like or dislike a song, so it will tailor itself to what you like. You get an ad when you first start your app, and then it plays smooth and as long as you want! I think my favorite part is that you can pin your favorite station straight to your home screen. I have an Android phone, so I can't say that it happens on Windows or Apple products, but I love just having to press the one button and have it open the station I want. It saves me a button press, and lets me just press the button and lock the phone to get to work. I think the only con for this app is I can't listen to stand up comedians, and I can't figure out how to make a Broadway Musicals station. For those, I'm stuck with Pandora, but I can deal with that. I don't listen to musicals and comedians as much, now that I have iHeart Radio anyway. It has only randomly shut down once, but it was playing for three hours straight, so I didn't think it was an app problem. It's smooth, doesn't take long to load, and offers lyrics for nearly every song!"

We just turned on the Install from other sources button in the menu and downloaded an older .APK file of the App from the Internet. Using the File Manager App and going to Downloads, we found that Iheartradio installed the older version just fine. The older Iheartradio .apk file is available if you look for it. I just transferred it from my Windows computer to Downloads in the Kindle First Generation and it installed and works just fine. We don't have all the latest Pop Up Video Advertisements but everything about the I Heart App works great. The reason I knew that the New App should work is because we own two of the exact same model Kindles. The second Kindle was not reset and the Newer App is working Great with it.

I have the Spotify App where I have a lot of free music stored as well.The only thing I can say that I may dislike the iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio is that I need WiFi or cable service so I can access the Internet.  I love this free music App because I can browse several types of music depending on my taste for that day.  I had the Spotify Premium subscription where I could download my favorite music when I signed up for the Amazon Prime subscription.  I enjoyed the Amazon Prime subscription so much and decided to continue with it.  The Amazon Prime subscription is far less than the Spotify Premium subscription, and gives me access to kindle and computerized books, music, videos, television, etc.  Therefore, I cancelled my Spotify Premium subscription and just keep the free online music.I highly recommend the iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio App because it is free, allows people to access any type of music they desire!

"11961","iHeartRadio","Goodbye Spotify, Hello iHeartRadio!","Moxie","June 6, 2014",5,"I had not heard of iHeartRadio until I got my Kindle Fire HD 7"" and now I don't know how I tolerated the unpaid edition of Spotify on my laptop for so long. You can listen to live radio stations or create your own customized station by either song or artist.  So, when I plugged in Celine Dion, not only do I get, at random, various songs of hers, but it also begins playing similar artists (which is a good way to learn of different artists).  If you like the song playing, it offers a thumbs up and a thumbs down button.  If you like the song, it acknowledges that and continues to play; if you don't like the song, it stops immediately and avoids playing it again.  If you don't click on either up or down, random songs of similarity will continue to play indefinitely.  If you want to retain the Celine Dion customized station, just click on the + button to add it to your favorites; it will be there the next time you access iHeartRadio.  The beauty of iHeartRadio is no commercials!  Of course, if it's live streaming of a radio station, you will hear those commercials, but there are no commercials on the customized stations!  There is probably even more to discover about iHeartRadio, but this is my early introduction and usage to date, and I'm loving it!  The app is free on Kindle Fire HD 7"", another plus!"

Kind of a shame, really, since the radio station I like to listen to doesn't have enough wattage out to reach my home. It worked on my previous Android Device beautifully.EDIT: Since getting the new Nexus Tablet, I re-downloaded this app. Now I can listen to my favorite Spokane, WA, radio station again...and ""Nights With Alice Cooper"" :D"

You can simply bypass the suggestions and move ahead to listening.  There are ads as on most radio stations, but you move on to the next choice if you don't want to hear them. Brief description given on kind of music offered per station and listing of cities abround the US.  Nice download."

"11967","iHeartRadio","Super Solid Internet Radio App, Clear Cut Privacy Policy","Tinfoot","May 22, 2014",5,"What a honest, neat app!  First, a quick treatment concerning the permissions.  I did go through ClearChannel's ToS and Privacy Policy, and everything is upfront and optable.  ClearChannel only shares information with 3rd Parties in two cases: a) delegation directly involved in providing app services b) when the user *voluntary* opt-ins for marketing (none of that ""you automatically agreed to get marketed"" guff).  When I initially looked at the social circle registration,  I was able to easily modify what circles could see and be involved in ClearChannel notifications.  The email address registration is the most ""private"" method of registration.  All the permissions requested are legit and used for various app services.There are in-app adverts; however, they only popup once in awhile and in no way impede streaming, nor does one notice them if the device is in Screen Lock while playing.  These simple adverts only prevent you from tapping the Like/Dislike buttons until you ""X"" out of them.  Otherwise, for a freebie radio with custom channels, this is still the most unobtrusive advertising vs pratical function scheme I have seen.As for app design, I have fooled around with various Internet Radio apps in the past and always inevitably deleted them due to bad, confusing, advertising riddled interfaces.  iHeartRadio is the first one that really has a clear GUI.  I did have to do some initial random button pushing to figure out what was what, but in about 6 minutes I had my custom ""Beatles"" channel made and audio commercial-free streaming.  Sweet!  I especially love the mix selector.  Double Sweet!  On top of everything, a moderately low RAM footprint (approx 46mbs during streaming, less than my Chrome Browser).  This app gets 5 solid stars and a Woot!*Addendum: As of 20Jun14, apparently a recent update has done away with the intermittent static adverts and replaced them with a single streaming advert at the beginning, in this case a T Mobile commercial.  Can't exit out of it, but it is rather short and bearable for a free radio service.*"

It was the greatest thing I had ever seen, and I loved that it was completely ad free... notice how that is past tense.  After listening to it for a few weeks, I began to realize I was hearing the same song over... and over... and over....... and over, again.  There is very little variety on this app.  That being said, it is free and it will stream non-stop until you turn it off (unlike the free version of Pandora, which turns itself off when it decides you are no longer listening).  My wife uses this app to keep music playing in my sons room while he sleeps, through the night.  Unfortunately, it too will shut of, unexpectedly, which creates a silence that almost always wakes him up.  This can get annoying when it is 2 in the morning and I have to get up in an hour and a half.  All of that being said, it is free.  You can't expect to get things for free and them to be as good as something you pay for, all I ask is they put a litttllleee more time and effort into this app."

Like Larry the Cable Guy and John Pinette and Jim Gaffigan and Lewis Black, you get the idea.  There are only a few from each performer than a bunch of others like Ralphie May and Gabrielle Eglesis.  I believe they are come on's to buy the albums but still there is a lot of content here.  And tons of music.  I run it on my Kindle Fire HD and think it is great.

McCord","August 29, 2015",4,"It is 100% better than any radio station out there today; that being said, it does not come close to the stations, and the independent format of decades ago. How many remember the ""King Biscuit Flower Hour""?  There are literately millions of albums and singles out there which are never played; although not a top 40 format, they do repeat the same song within a few hours. I remember well the great independent format of the late 60's and early 70's WQSR 102.5  Sarasota FL; its call letters were Quad 102 1/2, in today's market everything pre-recorded on a disk, I doubt if ever we will see or I should say hear real music format again."

The only problem is the selections.  This program doesn't have that wide a selection which you choose a station.  Say you choose Katy Perry.  They'll also play Selena Gomez, Demi Levato, and Ariana Grande.  Unfortunately I can think of several others that should come up becuz I ahve the same station on Pandora and they dont.  I could of course just pick a different station but finding something that would suit all my needs is a pain and you can't combine stations or I would have.

Unlike what others said, you do NOT need a facebook account to use this (maybe this was the case in the past, but not aymore). I signed up just using my email, which I didn't mind.My only issue with this app is that it can crash sometimes on my Kindle Fire when trying to open it. Other than that, it works great. Other good radio apps are Pandora and TuneIn Radio (live stations)."
"11991","iHeartRadio","Awesome","Nicole Bloodgood","January 8, 2017",5,"This app is so perfect. Love the variety! I learned about new artists I really like because when you make one station for a certain song or artist it includes other songs along the same genre. The only issue is having to be connected to the internet, but other than that I get to l listen to Melanie Martinez, Twenty one pilots, My Chemical Romance, Panic! At The Disco, Black Veil Brides, Evanascence and so much more at its best."
"11992","iHeartRadio","Getting Better","TGautney49","January 4, 2015",5,"I've always preferred this over Pandora because the ads are less intrusive (there are no commercials in the radio except for random times when you first open a custom radio station. Even then it only happens once, but most ads are pop-ups within the app itself). There is also no premium version that you have to pay monthly, therefore you are getting best quality already... for free! Also there are not only custom radio stations, but real radio stations all over the U.S. and Canada. Another plus over Pandora is the fact that you can &#34;tag&#34; a station (doesn't matter if it is a real station or not) as your favorite so that you can easily access it instead of searching for it every time or looking in your recently played section.  (As far as I know, there is no limit on the amount of favorites that you can have.) The more you use the program (there is an online website at www.iheart.com) the better it gets to know you do that it can predict your search! Even better is the fact that it has gone through so many updates and bug fixes that the layout is not only easier to navigate, but also a better quality app."

So I looked on the internet and found iHeart Radio.  I'm 60 years old and this app is very user friendly, I have no trouble with it.  I can listen to Sean and Rush on WOR radio, in New York City, of all places (I live in WA State),  I give this app 5 stars for easy to use and it works wonderful on my Kindle, or my computer and even on my Windows phone.

Then I found great jazz stations around the U.S. on this app, so all is good.The only downside is that this app keeps insisting that I signed-up for a pop-country station...the kind that plays big money bling country.  If I was interested in a country station, I would only want to hear old school country that is real...not the crap that is cranked out by the Illuminati millionaire machine.  Until a station like that lands on the iHeart app, I will keep turning-off the station that I did not add to my selections on this app (it keeps defaulting to that dreadful station...argh!)"

"12002","iHeartRadio","I just love this app","Roberta","September 4, 2014",5,"I just love this app.  I put on my favorite station while I'm exercising, and the time just flies.  I love The Beatles station, which is what I happen to listen to while I'm on the elliptical, and the mix of songs they play is fantastic.  I guess I can only speak for that station at this point, but for that one alone, it is worth the download.  I also listen to some of the ""talk"" shows, but there are a lot of breaks in the show for commercials about the show itself.  I don't think it has anything to do with the app because I've listened my favorite show on regular radio, and there are A LOT of commercial breaks.  At least you don't have to listen to commercial commercials, but it is still frustrating.  I'll have to explore some more music stations, but so far, I couldn't be happier.  I hope iHeartRadio keeps The Beatles station.  They are showing it as ""celebrating 50 years"" of their music, so I'm wondering if the station will disappear at the end of the year.  I sure hope not."

But there is one ting about the app I absolutely CANNOT STAND. You have a limited number of times you can skip songs. That is just stupid on SO many levels. Why in the heck would an app have limited skips?!?!?!?! How stupid can you get? The other problem is that you can't be under 14 or something like that to get an account.

Honestly, I've heard the iHeart radio app commercial on the radio so many times that over and over I thought: Oh, another Pandora music station thing. :P (insert eye roll here). However, I am so impressed! I never thought I could substitute an actual radio, iTunes, mp3, or Pandora but this is so much better than Pandora! Warning before you go any further: I did sign up with my email. They have so many radio/ playlist options to choose from based on your favorite types of music.  Thus far, I've not heard any songs I hate. Not only this, but the app is free. FREE! Take that Pandora! On my kindle, at least, it plays on while I go surf the web or play other apps which I find really cool. It seems as if you don't have to use your email to use the app but you'll be able to customize your radio if you do. It's definitely worth the free payment and gigabite storage for you music lovers out there. I definitely recommend this app to all you and I'm very picky about which games, videos, apps, books, etc. I put on my device. I hope this review was worth the read! Have a great day. :)"

The selection and the variety was enormous. The fact that the signal was clear, not choppy or muffled was a shoe-in for me.  I'd recommend this app to everyone who wants to listen to music rather than commercials.The cons: I was putting my backsplash up in my new kitchen over the ENTIRE weekend and Every hour or less, I heard the same darn commercials over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again the entire weekend; all 5 of them.  Well, thats the same thing local radio channels do but, every 15 minutes... so, I guess its a PRO CON.  LOL."

"12010","iHeartRadio","Great Access to Music, Lousy UI","Cody Montana","February 15, 2014",3,"Reviewing this app is challenging because one must distinguish between content, recommendations, and application's features, functionality, and user interface in both web and mobile versions. Overall, I like the system but hate the app. Here are the details.What I Like:- Huge content library that enables one to explore and discover lots of new music- Good album recommendations algorithm provided by EchoNest identifies relevant new albums to explore- Excellent Autoplay feature provides highly relevant new tracks (i.e., recommended tracks)- Web interface is very usable, providing intuitive navigation to the various featuresWhat I Dislike:- Mobile app's functionality is brittle; it freezes periodically, and can be slow to respond to user navigation. Buffering seems insufficient; momentary breaks in WiFi connectivity seem to cause major hiccups, such as ""hunting"" for the appropriate volume level or freeing the app.- Mobile app's features are imbalanced; on the one hand, it provides a great many choices for user behavior (social aspects, exploration and discovery aspects, recommendations at the album and track level, etc.) but on the other hand overwhelms the user with a great many options while failing to prioritize the important use cases by means of appropriate defaults and user customization etc. For example, I have zero interest in seeing what albums or collections are ""hot"" in my neck of the woods, yet this is shoved in my face as the default content in the left-side start-up screen menu that I cannot configure- Much of the app interface's flow seems to differ from that of the web interface, which is confusing- Transparent or ""disappearing control"" UI design in web interface, while trendy these days (e.g., Gmail folder scroll bar) , is a pain; scrolling bar disappears unless you hover directly over it, and since two-finger scrolling only works within the dynamic frame, you end up doing a lot of repetitive actions or hunting around to surface the scroll bar on a basic UI nav function that should be something you don't even have to think about."

I particularly enjoy using this app because I can just choose a station that fits whichever chore I'm working on or musical mood I'm in and I can listen wherever I am without worrying whether the station will tune in well or have static as I often experienced and was frustrated by with any alarm clock or other type of standard radio receivers! I have this app installed on my kindle fire HD as well as on my smartphone and I regularly use both! Also, I love that you are able to log in either through your Facebook account or, if you're like me and don't care to share your listening preferences with all your friends (my preferences vary so extremely that I would probably come across as having a multiple personality), through your email. Finally, I love that the commercial breaks aren't overwhelming...from what I recall I would say that the commercial breaks are comparable to a standard radio station such as what I used to listen to before this app!"

And u can search names if songs and stuff while ur still listening. The music will also work if u go on another game. And I have a kindle so while im playing my game I can slide that thing from the top down and cut it off, skip it, or pause it. And speaking of skipping the things, u have limited daily skips, I wouldnt skip so much and waist the skips. But see im only 10 so for me this is the best app for music I can get. But when u type in a song or name or album it has to be exact or it will say &#34;Song Not Found&#34;and stuff. But this is a great app for music and I recommend this app for all ages. Best app I can get. Get this app if like music."
"12017","iHeartRadio","Fantastic!!!","Awesome girl","October 1, 2015",5,"This app is the best! If you have a favorite song, you can create a customizable station just for you around that song, and sculpt it to your taste in music over time. They have loads of genres available, and tons of predesigned stations around those genres. You can listen to your local radio, too, if that's your cup of tea. But I would give this app 11/10! Best music experience I've had with any app ever. Which reminds me, why are reading this when you could be downloading iHeartRadio?? It's actually free, it won't cost you a single penny, unlike other apps."

My guess is that there is a bit of code that looks at the next song on the playlist and if it isn't available at Amazon, then that song will get automatically skipped."

Weather it's the apps one uses, or if there in no proper signals which is frustrating (digital! Got to love it!). It still is an awesome app because it has the best stations to choose from and of course setting up your own stations and being able to purchase music you like. It may never be a 5 star app for me (until it can get a clean signal that stays clean for longer than 30 minutes). It always fails when your listening to something interesting (conspiracy much!!!).

It's not a huge deal for me. I have a Facebook account. But I HATE it when sites want me to use that since I consider it a security/privacy risk to log into everything using Facebook. Let's face it, Facebook can't even keep people from making damaging, virus laden applications so they are hardly the epitome of safe sites. I prefer setting up different passwords for different sites.This app also seems to have issues keeping track of the songs I've liked and disliked when I shut it down and restart it. The web version doesn't seem to be synched up to the app version despite me logging into my account to get my personalized stations. That's a shame because I keep having to tell it I hate certain artists to get it to not play them every time I use the app on my Kindle.Other than that, I have no problems with it. It allows me to get my favorite radio stations I've been missing since I moved away from Houston to New Jersey. It can be run in the background while I play games or read my books, which is awesome. You can't expect perfection for free. It does what it promises which is more than I can say for some apps I've had. :-D"

"12031","iHeartRadio","Wonderful Way to Get the Kind of Music You Want","Russell W. Shurts","March 18, 2014",5,"I suspect I could use this service to get live sports talk or news and opinion, but so far I have only used it to create my own 'radio stations' based on some of my favorite musicians and singers.  iHeartRadio allows you to select a particular recording artist to create a 'radio station' from and it will automatically select songs that are similar in style to the artist you have picked.  It is a novel way of providing music, and the system gives you the ability to give a thumbs up or thumbs down on any music selection you listen to.  In this way you can get your station or stations to be very close to the type of music you would like to listen to at that time.It's wonderful to be able to get music this way, and like I said there is probably a lot more I could do with the service beyond just the music."
"12032","iHeartRadio","Difficult","problemnoticergirl","July 7, 2017",1,"Where do I start? As soon as I opened the app it'd open a random station I didn't even choose, it's super slow, and recently it's been telling me I can't UAE it because something from my app store wasn't updated! I haven't received any notifications for updates for your app of my app store whatsoever so I assume this is some sort of problem. This is the only app I know where I can put my alarm to music I like but it's not worth constantly being kicked out of the app over and over again just to turn on the alarm for any set of days and to turn it off. I'm better off deleting it."
"12033","iHeartRadio","Decided to try after hearing them featured on the radio","Stella Carrier","December 12, 2014",5,"I also decided to give listening to the iheartradio  feature after seeing them featured online-through one of the local radio stations in the Washington d.c. area.  Anyhow, as in Pandora, iheartradio carries a wide range of music and stations to listen to. It is hard for me to choose whether I like Pandora or iheartradio more due to both apps containing a diverse range of music. Additionally, iheartradio has played music that has been a major mood booster for me during times that my faith and trust have been tested. I also like that iheartradio recommends other stations to try as I‚Äôm listening to their music. I have over 30 music stations in my iheartradio profile due to my diverse tastes in music. For instance, the don‚Äôt stop dancing radio station came into my awareness after iheartradio featured it to me as a result of the different music I have already listened to on their site. The number of stations and musicians that I have featured in my iheartradio profile could take up another review. However, here is a sampler of the stations/artists that the iheartradio app and website have allowed me to save in my profile; Madonna, pet shop boys, deppeche mode, tiesto, armin van buuren, calvin harris, 2am ambient, pitbull,dancin 90s, Britney spears , adam lambert, euro-dance, Darren hayes, foofighters, the 90s unglued, one republic, lasgo, Swedish house mafia, ellie Goulding, Fergie, robin Williams and many more that could take up the length of the minimum words required for another amazon review. As you can see, the app and website of iheartradio is perfect for those who enjoy a wide range of preferences in music."
"12034","iHeartRadio","It's okay as long as you like the programming","A photographer","May 16, 2013",3,"If you enjoy listening to your local Clear Channel radio stations, you will probably like this app.  You also gain access to numerous other Clear Channel radio stations around the country with various programming formats and genres.  The limitation is that this is pretty mediocre programming.  I'm not a big radio listener due to the lack of variety in the music being programmed.  No matter what the genre, corporate radio manages to play music that all sounds the same.  Since radio plays homogenized sounds, recording companies record music that all sounds the same.  Pretty boring stuff.To be fair, I've not sampled every single radio station offered on this app.  I am familiar with the local stations (typical of the music described above) and what other stations I've sampled seem to have the same programming.  So, if you like this type of music, you'll enjoy this app."
"12035","iHeartRadio","I heart radio app","Vladimir Calderon","January 4, 2016",3,"To be honest here the app design sucks, I mean it is very disappointing the fact that you need to go by state or country in to oder to find a radio station. You should make the app more simple and similar to the surface rt or Xbox 360 iheart radio app. In the surface rt or Xbox 360 when searching for a live radio station from its genre it shows all the radio stations from all over the world in that genre that you first chose. Another thing is when creating radio stations the search bar should be smarter."

"12037","iHeartRadio","Radio on the go","BluesHawk707","September 14, 2013",4,"The iHeartRadio app is very easy to use and can be tailored to your musical preferences.  It uses the device's wireless to connect to the radio stations you love so you have to be connected to the internet or some sort of public wireless system for it to work.  I found it enjoyable to use - you can choose radio stations near you or ones from where you are from if you are traveling.  It lists the artist and song title during each song so you know what's playing.  I found it does drain the battery considerably with prolonged use (an hour or so) but it's not much different than similar apps so you may want to keep it plugged in if you are going to listen to it for a while.What I did like is the ability to listen to new music and to learn who the new up and coming artists were.  Again, very convenient way to listen to music and know who you are listening to."

There are a few other Internet Radio options and I actually have downloaded others and compared them to iHeart radio.  This is the best one for me hands down!  I love building my own stations that I listen to depending on my mood and what I feel like listening to at the time.  The only complaint that I have (which is a minor one) is the skip limit.  Usually the songs that are playing are exactly what I  want to hear, but sometimes I do have the need to skip a few songs in a row and I hate having a limit.  I would actually pay to have the option of unlimited skips.  I think that should be an option and I'm sure there are other listeners out there who would pay for this feature as well.  I still am fairly new to the app, but am enjoying  all my favorite artists and songs very much!"

Artie Shaw still sounds great.BUT. iHeart does a tremendous job of visuals to go along with the music.Visuals add up to excess bytes of info quickly.I had to uninstall the APP as my data usage count surged in just a few uses.If I had a good internet connection with more data per month I would be back to iHeartRadio it is a very good product.It is much better than most of the internet radio apps that I have tried.

Oh no, it's just iHeartRadio sucking as usual. I had to use this app while living in Costa Rica because Pandora wasn't available. It was depressing.

When you create stations to listen to songs, for example, if you create a pink station to listen to songs only from Pink- you will find that there are songs from other artists on there. This is a frustration for my 12 year old daughter who wants it to have only songs from pink on her pink station.However, if you push the thumb down on a song, it almost never plays that song again.We have this app on our phone, our ipad, our kindle, and so on. It is an easy to use app.Well worth the effort. Enjoy."

Installed this ap on a kindle fire HD.The good:- price is right (free)- multiple stations for every type of musicThe issues:- Searching for stations is trial and error (I didn't spend a ton of time on this, but when selecting a type of music, then had to go by state to select a station - how do I know whether Alabama or Vermont has better alt rock stations?)- I get a ""click"" about every 10 sec - not very loud, but gets annoying after a while.  I don't know if this is due to my Kindle, my WIFI, the internet provider, or the ap, but it is annoying enough that I only use this for background music when doing something else, don't just sit and listen.Overall, worth trying, hopefully the clicking is a resutl of my set-up vs something in the ap.  If the ap, only useful whne nothing else available."

I got this for my Kindle fire for picking up local stations that sometimes get interferred with by stations coming in from Canada(I live on the North Coast) and my stations come in crystal clear. It is pretty easy to use too. All you need to do is pick your home state(or any other state for that matter) and a city and boom, your listening to that station in real time just like it's in your own backyard. There is also an option to make your own station by picking only the music that interests you. That feature I have yet to explore in its entirety, but when I do, I'll perhaps come back and edit this review. Until then, get this app and enjoy your music! And, one more thing: It's FREE! You'd be denying yourself if you don't at least give it a try. If you don't like it, delete it. Happy Listening from the North Coast!"

Thanks for making something as unique and a awesome app that has every single type of music, it has a variety of different elements that make it better than Pandora.Thanks again  Ryan D. DuffyP.S. I need to add that the Amazon Customer Service Reps answering the phones (anytime day or NIGHT!) Are so professional, personable, and fast. Every time I've had an issue with my Kindle, Amazon has called me immediately and done everything they could to not only fix the problem but they show you thing's you may not of known about your Kindle and how to maneuver the apps and programs to make it suit your every day needs. They've never got impatient, sarcastic, or acted like someone needing help is a waste of their time. They are genuine and I can't say enough good things about my experiences. I myself am in the Customer Service industry and when someone treats me like there talking to a friend not a customer I want to continue to use and purchase whatever I may need from them and tell all my friends, family or business how great and easy Amazon is.

"12085","iHeartRadio","Great If You Want To Listen To Their Choice","PHX Ray","April 30, 2016",1,"When it works, its wonderful. When it doesn't, its maddening.IHeart is constantly loading stations into the FOR YOU section. You cannot turn that off, even by de-selecting any favorites in their list of station offerings. No one thought to activate the SAVE button to stop suggestions. Its as if they don't think you have the intelligence to search for new options.The favorites I have in MY STATIONS include about 40 that I cannot delete, nor do I want. And they like to randomly change order so that when I go to a favorite, I have to search all over for it among dozens that I would like to clear out. That's a pain. There should ALWAYS be a delete option available.In terms of use on a phone, occasionally you need to stop IHeart to use another phone function like a text or photograph and quite often, IHeart will shutdown halfway through a podcast and you'll be unable to find that episode to resume. Its as if it thinks you heard part of it and quit it because you didn't want to hear it anymore. The ability to select from different talk radio episodes is hit or miss. Sometimes it gives you a choice, often it shows no options, even though your were just there 30 seconds ago and IHeart shut down on you. That is a royal pain if the episodes button does not include previous and unheard shows. Those options should remain for a period, like 7 days.Also, the changeover from WiFi to roaming data acquisition is wanky and sometimes you miss a bunch of the segment as you walk away from your house.All-in-all its loaded with really juvenile functions that remind me of ""jiggle play"" on the early iPods. If the programmers would simply allow the user to streamline the product to suit their needs without trying to cram unwanted content into the user's experience, they would appeal to more people. I barely have enough time to get caught up to the stations I want to listen to. When the clunky-wanky program interferes with that aim, the user has a less than pleasurable experience. After trying to correct or re-load the app on my Android phone, I finally deleted it all-together and will search for another solution without feature bloat. Software serves the user. Not the other way around."

You can do tons of stuff with the email address account , or even without signing in at all; those people who say they have to delete their app just because they don't have a Facebook don't know what they're talking about. You do have a limit on how many times you can skip songs, but you can listen forever, and the skips reset the next day. There are commercials but JUST right before the station starts playing, and they're only thirty seconds long. They don't have every radio station available, but you can find your favorite artist/band and make them into their own station so you can listen anytime you want. I also love that you can exit the app and it will still play! And that you can choose if you want the most popular songs by a singer/band, or want to hear music that you might not have heard before.

I tolerated them on IHR because they only ever seemed to come up when I logged in and they were infrequent.  Lately, it seems like every time I log in and whenever I switch stations.  I tolerated the UI change a few months ago because I had to.  I tolerated the repetition that threatened to kill songs like Lodi through endless repetition and the songs that don't belong on the station no matter where the dial is set because I ASSumed that they were collecting data on my skips and thumbs down and would improve.  I tolerated the skip limit because I figured Clear Channel would just say something dismissive like 'use your iPod' if I complained(oh, wait...I did!) so I just figured I'd look for a paid version.  It didn't come up(at least not conspicuously) and I lost patience just like when I try to sit through eternal and irritating commercials because I want to hear Bill Handel.  That's why I only listen to KUSC any more.  Congrats, Clear Channel; you drove a head of cattle away from the chute!  You get a second star for helping me wake up."

For one is the commercial you are forced to listen to every time to power the app up.  It's fairly short, so it's sufferable, but it's still annoying.  The other thing is that the radio will just go off for no reason.  You'll be listening and then all of a sudden nothing.  Also, I was a bit confused by the ""create your own station"" aspect of the app. I typed in one of my fav. singers and thought it would play just his songs, but it didn't, it plays anyone that is a similar genre, which is okay, just was not what I expected.  The app is great especially since it's free and you can take your radio station anywhere in the house with you, which is nice if you don't have good radio reception."

I grew up in Southern California and there was one station that I've been listening to since high school. Unfortunately, I ended up moving out of the county and couldn't get the station on the radio. Enter iHeart Radio. This app contains my favorite station so I can listen to it more matter where I am in the world. It works great with both WiFi and cellular data, and it plays perfectly on both my RAZR and Kindle Fire HD. Personally, I don't bother with logging into Facebook because I have no interest in creating my own stations.

IHeart Radio allows you to create your own station, however...once you select an artist you like, it only plays one song from that artist and then moves on to some other artist. If my station is created by clicking on a particular artist, I would expect ALL songs to be from that same artist. Also, the app kept shutting down or freezing up on me recently. I was able to get it going again, but only after it closed by itself about 4 or 5 times, so there are obviously issues with it. It would be nice to have more stations to choose from as well, especially for California. Most of the stations were East Coast (New York) based stations. Otherwise, once it plays it's great for a free app."

I have no problem with other apps like Pandora, but this app is better (in my opinion) It is very easy to use. It has so many stations and songs.

I am one of those that truly loves all music. This app is absolutely amazing for any kind of music lover though! I love that I can listen to 60's hits for a while then switch over to pop and finish up with a little country. Later maybe some soft rock and then blues and hey why not a bit of jazz.It has enough to make anyone get excited about music and keep you dancing all day long.The alarm features are perfect and the fact that I can listen to music while reading an ebook at the same time on my kindle is awesome!"

This is one app to get! Yes, it's free people. See why we like iHeartRadio? Also, you got a variety of other radio stations like 'Moves That Swagger Radio'. You can even look up different artists to see if they have a station like 'Nico and Vinz Radio', and you can build your own custom station. Now stop being amazed and get this app! Prepare to be bopping your head."

I like that you can listen to some live music channels without having to log into Facebook or an email account. But it seems that if you want to customize at all what channels you want to listen to, it forces you to log in to Facebook or an email account, which I usually don't feel like going to all the bother to do. So my selection of music is limited due to that. Usually I just like to open apps and use them without going into another account. But it is a free app at least, which is good."

My one warning, when you type and artist/band name, for a personalized radio, you don't just get that artist, you get that and any artist similar....Which is a pro or con depending upon your musical preferences. I find it a pro because I find music I might not have found otherwise, but I can see how it could be a con for some. easy to use."

It does load quickly on a Kindle HD but the interface is a little clunky and takes too much user action to search and the station list, domestic and international, is very small compared to other services.Recommended stations automatically pop up and the developers should take a look at whatever algorithm they use for this feature because most of the stations recommended for me are way off the mark when compared to the stations I have been selecting. It's frustrating.Icons and text are a size geared more for smartphone screens rather than Kindle screens. For a Kindle, it would be more efficient and easier to use if they were smaller."

I still prefer the musical experience of Pandora better, but the option to listen to broadcast Radio is somewhat attractive. One thing that became a frustration was the enormous amount of commercial minutes aired each hour on broadcast Radio. After listening to Pandora for several years I became accustomed to commercial free music. I don't care to listen to 20 minutes of commercials every hour."

Very annoying.  I'm constantly having to mess with my Kindle to get the Pandora to work past a commercial.  So I downloaded iHeart.  it's great.  It took a few minutes to download to my Kindle, but so far it was well worth it and it didn't cost anything to download the app thru Amazon.  You have to sign on thru an email or facebook account, but it works great.  I recommend it.  I can listen all day to music or radio stations....totally awesome."

I have saved my home stations (like I do on my desktop computer) but can't call them back up to switch over.  The ""Stations"" tab is annoyingly blank.  Also need to remember call letters for stations and it's harder to search by area station is in.  Just received an update today, so we'll see how it works out...This was originally downloaded to my new smartphone (where I have had the problems).

They even have talk shows! I find myself listening to Science Friday all the time.Their personalization is fantastic! If you have ever used Pandora, you may be familiar with how far off ""similiar"" they can track. iHeartRadio quickly adjusts to your likes and dislikes. I have found many more artists that I enjoy but have never heard of through this app.Only downside is that I can't view individual songs that I have favorited in the past. It may just be me, but I am pretty good at navigating software."

No it doesn't lag, doesn't shut down on me, etc, but it DOES make me watch an ad before I can listen. That's my first pet peeve with this. The second one is the fact that I have a SKIP. LIMIT. It annoys me so much, I can't stand it. I have several customized stations, and the thing is, if there's a song I don't like or I actually want to get to a song by the band/artist, I can't. Why? SKIP LIMIT. why is the skip limit a thing?Overall, a decent app. The sound quality is good, there are no commercials in between each song on the customized stations, and it's easy to use. This app and I have somewhat of a love/hate relationship."

So far I've found about 6 different KISS or KIIS FM stations from various large cities and none of them play any of the music I want to hear.  I'll probably play around with the preferences within the ap to see if I can get more stations to audition but I'm not hopeful.  At least the ap (and the usage) are free so I've only wasted my time at worst.  Note - I thought each radio station had to have a unique call sign but apparently things have changed with the internet age."

But the local Columbus, Georgia,,,and surrounding Alabama..station 103 (102.9) runs the John Boy and Billy. ""Big Show"" 6 days a week from 6am to 10 am EST. And I faithfully listen to the show. I can get it on my Android phone and iPad as well! So I rate a four star to  iHeart for having the programming flexibility for airing the Big Show. Other people I know say the same and that iHeart should suspend the hard rock during the Big Show. And then they can pick it up after the Big Show audience has turned off the station.....because they have. And the hard rockers can have their music back for 20 hours and all day Sunday, when the Big Show is not broadcast!"

I love that you can stream live radio from the app, especially because this way I can listen to my fav radio stations wherever I am, regardless of whether there is a tower nearby. My ONLY complaint, and it is little, is that when you are making a custom station, you can't add more than one band or artist to add more variety. But I also have Pandora, which does do that, so it is not a big deal. Overall, I highly recommend this app!!"
"12177","iHeartRadio","Cool app","TxMomoftwo","January 13, 2014",5,"Looking for an app to listen to music on my Kindle and decided to give this one a try. It has a couple of different features that I haven't tried like an alarm clock but it does have a couple different radio stations.  Not tons of stations just a couple from across the country in each different genre of music.  It does have a comedy channel.  For a free app it doesn't have lots of commercials, but every 5 minutes or so you'll get a 5 second commercial. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a way to play radio on your kindle."
"12178","iHeartRadio","Pandora Is Better","Book6","September 25, 2015",3,"Not nearly as good as Pandora. I think iHearRadio claims to have more songs in their library than Pandora, but I don't see how that's true.  I listened to one of their pre-made stations- not a live radio feed- and heard a couple songs repeat in a few hours.  I never have that with Pandora.  That being said, it is nice to have the additional variety of pre-made stations available beyond the genre stations on Pandora.  iHearRadio is a good compliment to Pandora, but if this was the only internet ""radio"" available I would think that internet radio is lame."

I was also not able to find certain talk show hosts on IHeart radio either.  Very disappointing."
"12180","iHeartRadio","Great app!!!","Latrice","September 19, 2013",4,"I love this app. It gives you different radio station to listen to. Even the ones outside your local station. It's easy to use. You can save your favorite channels and there's a search box to look for specific ones. The two cons for me are the commercials that comes on when the station is first turned on, in addition to the commercials that comes on with the regular radio stations,  but it's only for less than a minute so that's ok and that it only works using WiFi or internet access. With this being a free app and it being convenient on my kindle fire and tmobile phone I can't complain. I will give it a five star if those two cons were pro. It's still a great app though :)"

Also, if you are out of town, or have a favorite station in a city that you used to live in, you can access those stations through this app!It works a lot better now than it did when initially released. I have very few problems with it. It usually builds up a slight delay from the actual radio station, but that just allows you to skip some commercials if you restart it at the beginning of a commercial break!I highly recommend this app to people that enjoy listening to radio stations without interruptions after leaving their car or home!"

Also when I click on Elvis Radio or Beatles radio, I wanted to hear them, and only one in 3-10 songs is what I wanted.  I have learned you have to ""program"" the stations to eventually play what you are wanting to hear.  I thought Elvis radio would play Elvis.  No so.  the first 10 songs you might get 3 Elvis then not again for 10 or more songs.  BOO!  It is a fun oldies station, but not what I was expecting.

The first time out was to live stream a specific radio station, which seems to be the best use of this app. Or using their pre-built play lists. To me it's not very user friendly when it comes to customizing, and to me the genres and artist lists seem limited. I don't really get their ""mood/activity"" suggestions either. I've been a big Pandora fan for several years, with a paid subscription and I would definitely use Pandora first.

There are many features for the listener to follow a song, artist and stations. Unfortunately, iHeart limits its playlist to the most commercially popular songs. So if you play a 60's artists or station, for example, expect to hear the same top 40 stuff as on the radio. This kind of makes the features useless, because the subscriber never gets to discover new music. Stop using fancy algorithms to sell the product, iHeart."

"12209","iHeartRadio","Not very good.","Casey","March 31, 2012",3,"The iHeartRadio app is okay, but not very good. The custom stations are repetitive and inaccurate compared to Pandora or Slacker. The app lacks the ability to add more artists as seeds. The interface is fast. Too fast. If you are not careful you could end up banning more than one song because it processes a ban so quickly. There is no way to undo it if you do. If it were not for the well implemented streams from real stations I would give this app a 2. But the custom station aspect of the app is not useful. If you want to listen to the real stations, I would recommend this app. If you just want the custom stations feature, I would recommend Slacker, Pandora, or Jango instead."

Started getting a white screen that rapidly turned to an unending black screen.  This won't work unless I used with the 1st loaded station at least I remembered where the pause button was.  It was a nice alarm clock replacement until I received my new owner from Amazon today at least.  Removed today because I wasn't able to delete the alarm I set.

I have saved DJ radio stations I like as well as customized ones by my favorite bands. There are also occasion stations that you can pick to listen to while you workout, study, drive, and many more.

Plus it is fun to hear ads for local stuff that I have absolutely no context for. ""Come on down to so-and-so's such-and-such and enjoy the best thingamabober this side of the Mississippi"".I really enjoy listing to this while I do yard work or chores.

Seems like your after the teen market here.  Why not call it Teen Heat Radio instead.  You will never attract the older generations beyond 28 years old.  Every station has just about the very same  theme to it,  it gets old very fast.  reminds me of all the 1980's radio stations all in one place."
"12224","iHeartRadio","Not Impressed","Dan K. Varns","June 28, 2014",2,"The way this was described it sounded like it would be a great way to listen to music I like. I created my own channel according to directions choosing an artist I liked. Well they play LOTS of that one artist, but not much of anyone else. They don't even offer many artists to even vote up or down. (like or don't llke) Since the artist I initially chose was male, they give me very few female artists to choose from. (only 2 so far) Now my station has about 20 songs that are played over and over. Tired of it after just a couple days."
"12225","iHeartRadio","Seems to cause sound issues","T. phillips","November 25, 2012",1,"I've been having a bit of difficulty, my first Fire had intermittent sound issues and Amazon replaced it (love you Amazon!!).  My new fire came in and I noticed sounds in apps that had never been there before, so I figured the first fire was defective.  I downloaded this app again on Thanksgiving morning and immediately started having sound issues again on the fire, not only in this app but in others.  I've deleted the app off the new kindle, reinstalled other apps that started having sound issues and things seems to be back to being fine again on the new fire.  My sister says she occasionally has issues with this app on her phone, so until Amazon gets to the root of my sound issue problem again, I won't be using  the app anymore.As for the app performance itself, eh, it's all right.  I would rather just use vevo or something and hear the song I really wanted to hear, not just hope that it will magically appear."

I turn it on when I'm working and need some soothing classical music or fun 80s tunes to get me through the day. Then, I'll switch over to one of My Stations after work to hear Disturbed or Pantera.I love the Sleep Timer feature, too, and use that when I travel and have a tough time falling asleep. Falling asleep to music just works!My only gripe ... I really like the Thumbs Up/Down feature for songs. However, I don't think the DJs are actually paying attention because I hear the songs I don't like every single day. There are millions of songs out there... we can hear more than Madonna and Adele every once in a while."

Or you can go to the &#34;Perfect for&#34; page to see what music is good for at the time. I think a lot of people request this app also. Plus, you can keep the music playing while at the home screen, when you are reading a book on your device, when you turn your device off, or just playing a game. I think this is a perfect app for any age and person. There is also a sleep alarm and a alarm to wake you up. You can also listen while you are getting an app or rating an app. This is a really perfect app."

I was able to get a radio station in my area but when I tried the search feature again for a second radio station in my area I had no luck yet finding one.  I searched with the radio station call numbers and then with the call numbers and the city.  No luck yet.  I would recommend this Ap but I hope that iHartRadio up grades their search to make it easier to find specific radio stations."
"12245","iHeartRadio","Disappointed","Rebel 62","July 17, 2015",2,"When I first used the app it worked flawlessly. About a month in (after some update)  the app would cut out for no reason and make no attempt to reconnect to the radio station.  Now the app cuts out  multiple times and I have to re-sign in and tap the play/pause button to reconnect to the station.  I use the TuneIn Radio app whenever this app acts up.  I would use TuneIn for everything but it can not play iHeart stations.  I really like my local iHeart station, but I can't stand how often the station cuts out and the app does not make any effort to reconnect unless you manually stop and start the transmission.... TuneIn will cut out occasionally but it has always retrieves the signals within a minute.  AGAIN THIS app does not seem to care about reconnecting after the signal cuts out."

You don't get the choices or freedom you should, but I do appreciate all of the different kinds of stations, etc."

It is simple to use.  Type in an artist, and voila, you are listening to that artist and more from the similar artists.  I have gotten to love new bands/groups through using this app.  The app shows pics of the group/artist as well, not a video.  More like a slide show so you can put a face with the name.  It has other features as well.  Try it, you an play around with the many options or stick with the basics.  You don't have to be afraid to try a band/group before you buy it as you can listen on iHeartRadio first!  Go for it!"

Makes me so ugh.  My phone seems to drop them a lot to and every time I started it again there's the fitness add again.  FYI there is much better options radio websites have links for there station.  Just bookmark them in your browser.  You can also play playlists from YouTube and even make playlists on your computer you can play anywhere.  I find when you play music from your browser it doesn't drop nearly as much as a app.  Maybe its just my area.  ENJOY!!!"

When you are signed in, you can get reccomended songs for kids, funny songs, and holiday songs. All of it is free, and there isn't a ton of ads popping up.

"12313","iHeartRadio","IHeart Radio Too Hard to Use","Mag","February 28, 2014",1,"It's a good concept, but I found it very confusing and downright impossible to set up especially where it came to adding or deleting favorites.  Also, I got stations on there from places like Baltimore, Boston, Miami -- what the?  I live in western Colorado -- what do I care about the east?  I was hitting the choices to see what would happen.  Once I got a station on favorites (always by mistake), it was futile to remove it from the list.  Know what?  I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trips -- what do I need this for?!  Just more headaches.  The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who don't sit hitting buttons all day long.  Lastly, there didn't appear to be enough stations I liked, i.e., liberal talk radio and traditional country music.  I'm  not a  Glenn Beck fan, nor do I listen to hip-hop, pop, and all the other 20-something stuff out there these days.  We Boomers aren't dead yet, people!  Provide something for our age group or lose business.  Thank you."

Add in a huge catalog and flawless streaming even on slow connections and you've got a winning app right here."

I live in Arizona and I am able to listen to different music stations from other States and live ones from my state just from my kindle fire! There are few advertisements. And they only show when you have been off the app for awhile or sometimes switching stations. That's the only time you see them and they range from 5 sec to 30 sec. It shows you the song, artist, and album cover when they play a song. Also, you can create a custom stations and set a timer for how long you want the radio on. The recent thing added is radio alarm. I am in love with this app and would highly recommend it to anyone."

And finally when you go to rate the app at the Apple store guess what happens? If you give it a low rating the review mysteriously gets immediately rejected!

I've contacted Iheart about this and was given several ideas of how to make the problem go away, but none have worked. Now, I'm inclined to think this may be an advertizing scheme of Iheart. Each time I have to restart the program, I have to listen to a commercial then the program I was listening to resumes. Does Iheart have a counter going on that ticks off one more tune in by a customer for the company they are advertising for?I'm inclined to think Iheart won't let this comment be posted."

This is commonly from a long-time Pandora Radio User. It has less interruptions as Pandora, and works more efficiently. (as an app) I don't have to upgrade to a different plan to get certain plans. It's seriously a really good app, I feel like I'm neglecting Pandora after the history we've had together. I sometimes get too guilty that I check in with Pandora just to see if it's ok (I'm normal, I swear!!) But anyways this is a wonderful app it's really miraculous.

The last station played should show as the first one on the list when I open this app on Fire TV.

Don't know if it would work with music,but probably not.My amazon shop.com almost never comes up on my tablet the way it should.

When you start hearing repeats you need to go reset your starting point.Considering the amount of music available to an 'online only' music service, it astounds me that they have to repeat somgs after only 90 minutes. (I thought that about broadcast radio too but got over that pretty quickly.)So I will use them occasionally but it is not the 'one place' to hear music."

I am not interested in listening to someone else's choices on the existing stations so I created my own. The most aggravating feature is the ""rate song"" function. Despite having told the app that I don't like or want songs from a particular artist, that artist still regularly appears. The ""rate song"" function also does not seem to recognize the genre of songs I select that I want to hear. Also, I have not found a way to suggest artists for the venue. Has a long way to go before it replaces Pandora."

Waste of download time.","SZ","December 5, 2013",1,"I was really excited about this app and I wanted to love it, but my experience just isn't good.  I downloaded the app because it was supposed to broadcast one specific station that I really wanted.  The station advertised that it is available on this app and the app itself also advertised the station.  However, after downloading, I clicked on the station to play it and my phone just sat silent.  I tried playing other stations, all of which seemed to work fine.  But the one station that I wanted, and the only reason I downloaded the app, did not work.  My husband had the app on his phone (which is a completely different model and OS) and the result was the same.  The app just would not play the desired station.  I would have written the experience off with a few more stars because other stations did work.  However, I contacted iHeartRadio via their reporting service and described my issue.  I never heard back from them.  As a result, I give three stars for the app not working as advertised and I lowered that to just one star because of the lack of response by the developer."

Also to make your own stations you have to sign up. I guess I'll keep on looking for free music apps because this one is sucky and scammy.

What I was impressed by was the lack of ads that a normal radio station would have, so you're able to listen to a constant stream of music, even if you're unable to choose exactly which song comes next. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do; don't give it a bad rating because you're looking for something else."

I tried to get Christmas music and it didn't do very well the first few songs were rap versions of Christmas and it would then not let me skip the ones I didn't like. I tried instrumental which by definition should not contain any vocals and within a couple of songs came up with vocals I was able to skip the first few then I hit the skip limit. I tried several other ""stations"" like Mannheim steamroller and soon had rap again. I then tried Trans Siberian and ended up after a few songs with some pretty heavy hard rock and techno rock. Which is fine but not what I had asked for. I had a lot better luck with Pandora in the past. I may have to reload Pandora and use it instead."

"12761","iHeartRadio","AWESOME MUSIC APP!!!!!","Mary Sanchez","May 9, 2012",5,"Have no idea why some people are not liking this awesome app. You DO NOT need a facebook to use it as others have stated. Have had no problems on my kindle fire. There is even an option that provides you the lyrics to the song you are listening to. If you don't want to listen to one of the radio stations you can choose a genre and it will play the kind of music you like most and when a song is playing you can hit a thumbs up so it plays more songs like that or the thumbs down and it wont play that particular song or band. Two words.....LOVE IT!!!!!!"
"12762","iHeartRadio","Better than Pandora","Carl D. Bennington","May 25, 2013",5,"I used to subscribe (paided for it) to Pandora just to listen commercial free. iHeartRadio is commercial free for free in addition to being able to listen to local radio stations. Now when friends in other states tell me about this or that great radio station that they have in their listening area, I can tune-in and see what they are listening to also. I use iHeartRadio on my tablets, my iPhone, and on my streaming enabled TV...IMHO SO much better than Pandora or Yahoo Music."

"12792","iHeartRadio","USED TO be may favorite app.  Now, it doesn't work.","Ed","June 24, 2015",1,"I use this a lot (or rather I used to).  It was my favorite Kindle app.  The app has an alarm that turns on my favorite morning station at 7am every weekday.  I would typically switch to a different station at 9 and continue listening (as I worked around the house) until lunch time. (Both are News/Talk stations).  My 4 kids use it on their Kindles and are all experiencing the same problem (""Daaaad...  my Kindle isn't working right..."").Several updates ago (about a month or so), it just stopped working.  When it does turn on (it's not reliable as an alarm anymore), it will play for a few minutes and then just stop playing.  I have to close the app (or stop the station) and then hit play again.  It will play for a few minutes then just stop playing again...I LOVED this when it worked.  Other than iHeartRadio and Audible, I don't really use my Kindle Fire HD.  Being able to listen to books or the radio while I do other things is important to me, but the latest version(s) just don't work.I tried another station, and it was the same, so it's not the station.  The previous version didn't do it, so I don't think it's my Kindle (besides, other radio apps and Audible all work fine).  If I switch to PC, it seems to work (no perfectly, but mostly) fine.  I'm sure it was an unintended consequence of a new feature or fixing some other problem, but THIS APP IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW.  :("

I like and dislike what I listen to. After awhile it sort of learns the songs I like and plays them. I leave the setting to mix so once in a while I have to vote on a new song. My music choice is rather mix, so this is perfect for listening to many music genres in one place (for free). It does required a good connection for use. Have not tested other features to buy music or set up stations, but this is my music app of choice. Pandora is a close second."

Seeing I usually listen on my phone at work I do not have the time to look and see what station I was listening to. I also like the way they set it up. Instead of hundreds of stations in one place you can search from town to town and it makes it so much nicer not to be scrolling through 100s of stations just to find a song you like. And the categories are right on the money. I search old country and I get the oldies not the 80s. LOVE it!I defiantly am recommending this to all of my friends. It is user friendly and I have never had a problem with the stream."

I listened for two hours one day while scrubbing the house. iHeart radio did not interrupt the music with meaningless ads, and there weren't any banner ads, or general garbage covering  my Kindle screen. I wasn't seriously thrilled with the listening experience, because iHeart played songs I did not listen to from the Awesome 80's."

I was so excited to get it. I read the reviews to see what everyone else was saying first though. I didn't realize you had thlo log into facebook. Sure, I have a facebook and I see my friends have logged theirs into iHeartRadio, but it shows what you're listening to. I'm not going to download it because I don't want my friends to know what I'm listening to. If you want my opinion, just get Pandora. It's free and all you need is an email."

It has a great feature that allows you to dial in very similar to not-so-similar artists and you can 'sculpt' the character of the station by rating a particular song, thumbs up/down. AND you can play outside the US. Pandora? NO! Also, you can get great information about the artist, and follow links to buy material."

"13201","iHeartRadio","WORST APP ON MY PHONE EVER","Jeff Hall","May 16, 2013",1,"This app usually crashes within the first minute of using it. It will lose the station signal and then search and not find it again. SOmetimes it will wait 15 to 60 seconds, find the signal and then drop it again, hen repeat the process.  Other similar apps such as TuneIn do not have this issue at all on my phone and are far better apps..  With I Heart Radio, I can be sitting two feet from a wi fi feed and it still drops the station and can't find it. Same issue if I am not near a wi fi and using cellular signal.  It also locks up on my desktop or laptop and drops stations, etc. I like the talk show personalities carried by I Heart Radio but cannot stand the app. It is extremely irritating.  I contacted I Heart Radio and they were of no help at all.  If I had other apps behave the same way I would suspect there is something wrong with my phone, but they all work like they are supposed to without a glitch.  It is more irritating to try to make this app actually work than to miss the shows I like to listen to.  An awful app with awful customer support to go along with it."

Clear Channel took away the ONLY rock station in Atlanta and replaced it with yet another bubble-gum pop station.  Atlanta already has at least FIVE other stations JUST like it.  They took away Project 9-6-1 leaving countless Project Family members without a radio home.  Clear Channel is a greedy corporation who blatantly refuses to listen to its customers and is only interested in filling their pockets with money.  Do what's right and help us Project Family members get our station back.  Don't download this app!  We're not asking for a whole lot.  We just want to rock on.  Is that so much to ask for?To Clear Channel:  Screw you!  Your ways of marketing are horrendous.  Keep your customers in mind.  Bring back our Project 9-6-1 and leave us the flip alone.  Take that bubble-gum pop crap station off our rock station!  If you think our anger will just fizzle out and fade away, you are horribly, horribly wrong.  The longer you go without listening to us, the harder we will fight back.  We live by one simple rule.  We live LOUD and we play HARD.Keep rocking on Project members!"

"13811","iHeartRadio","Monopolistic.","Josh","September 2, 2012",1,"This is a terrible application, indicative of the current state of radio.  Why do I need to download a proprietary app to listen to a radio station?  Why can't I surf to a website and stream from there?  Information.  Nobody is listening to garbage radio anymore and they need ratings information so they can sell you a new mattress.  Plus it's buggy.  Don't give in."
"13812","iHeartRadio","music at my fingertips!!","marieb","September 6, 2012",5,"Really enjoy iheart radio!!  I can have all my favorite music and favorite kinds of music available to me on my Kindle Fire."
"13813","iHeartRadio","facebook requirement","Matt S","September 5, 2012",1,"this thing wants a facebook account. really? come up with a new plan. I never give apps access to facebook. creates too many security and privacy issues. never chain accounts together! a hacker may gain access to one just to go after the others."
"13814","iHeartRadio","Since I'm not a loser I can't use it?","Joemomma","August 9, 2012",1,"Since I choose not to put my business online to a bunch of fake ""friends"" I can't create a station? Some of us can still think for ourselves and don't care that little skyler or caleb ate all his veggies. Shame on you. ihate this crap."
"13815","iHeartRadio","facebook","eil","September 8, 2012",1,"I wouldnt mind creating a regular account if so asked. The Facebook requirement is, unfortunately, a deal breaker for me."
"13816","iHeartRadio","Pandora is better","Ren","February 3, 2012",1,"Pandora is better and this seemed worthless.  I'm glad I didn't buy this because the reviews told me enough. I don't have a facebook so this would've been a complete waste."
"13817","iHeartRadio","Bad Reviews---Facebook","Isaac Taylor","February 11, 2012",1,"I'm going to try Tune-In Radio if these reviews are right in it REQUIRING Facebook access. Just to let ClearChannel know they are missing listeners here because of this."

"13819","iHeartRadio","Boycotting...","Zyaldar","September 5, 2012",1,"Clear Channel took away the longest running rock station in Atlanta and turned it into a pop station. We now have 5 pop stations and no hard rock. All those stations play the same music. The Project family will not stand for this. We will fight for our Project 9-6-1! Are you ready Clear? Its just going to get worse!"
"13820","iHeartRadio","Never","Will","November 25, 2016",1,"Always says unfortunately I Heart has stopped working. Wish I could give 0 stars."

"13823","iHeartRadio","recomemded","alannaborders","April 4, 2012",1,"I would recomend Pandora because it is better you can listen to the radio but you need internet but it is really awesome!!!!"
"13824","iHeartRadio","Sucks","Mable","January 3, 2012",1,"This app is ridiculous. I wanted to have it to listen to a local radio station. I have really good service, full bars PLUS a good WiFi connection, and yet its skips its way through everything. Most of the time I'm just listening to dead air, waiting for the song to come back for a only about 3 seconds before it is dead air again. Plus a lot of the time its not even playing the same thing as the radio station that I'm wanting to listen to. What's the point of trying to listen to a radio station when it won't even play what that station is playing. I think I'll just stick with Pandora."

LIVE LOUD PLAY HARD!!!!!!The new POWER 96.1 is another crappy top 40 pop sation in Atlanta. My beloved rock music is now gone and I have no good music to listen to.
