"12010","iHeartRadio","great access to music lousy ui","Cody Montana","February 15, 2014",3,"reviewing this app is challenging because one must distinguish between content recommendations and application s features functionality and user interface in both web and mobile versions overall i like the system but hate the app here are the details what i like: huge content library that enables one to explore and discover lots of new music good album recommendations algorithm provided by echonest identifies relevant new albums to explore excellent autoplay feature provides highly relevant new tracks web interface is very usable providing intuitive navigation to the various featureswhat i dislike: mobile app s functionality is brittle; it freezes periodically and can be slow to respond to user navigation buffering seems insufficient; momentary breaks in wifi connectivity seem to cause major hiccups such as hunting for the appropriate volume level or freeing the app mobile app s features are imbalanced; on the one hand it provides a great many choices for user behavior but on the other hand overwhelms the user with a great many options while failing to prioritize the important use cases by means of appropriate defaults and user customization etc for example i have zero interest in seeing what albums or collections are hot in my neck of the woods yet this is shoved in my face as the default content in the left side start up screen menu that i cannot configure much of the app interface s flow seems to differ from that of the web interface which is confusing transparent or disappearing control ui design in web interface while trendy these days is a pain; scrolling bar disappears unless you hover directly over it and since two finger scrolling only works within the dynamic frame you end up doing a lot of repetitive actions or hunting around to surface the scroll bar on a basic ui nav function that should be something you don t even have to think about "
