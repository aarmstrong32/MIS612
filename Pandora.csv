"1","Pandora","So far I really like it, but have only scratched the surface","meme22","December 28, 2014",4,"Just getting started with Pandora.  So far I really like it, but have only scratched the surface.  Got an IHome wireless speaker for my Kindle Fire HDX so I can not have music I like wherever I like.  There are commercials, but are not terribly annoyin."
"2","Pandora","Highly recommended","Buck Ziffero","February 5, 2014",5,"I have been a Pandora user for quite some time. I use it on all my computers at home and at my office.  I appreciate the fact that I can input the artists and style of music I prefer. If something is played I would rather not listen to again I can input that fact. I can listen to my playlist randomly, or select a particular artist/style to play.  I recently upgraded to a Kindle Fire HDX, and can now play music while I'm reading or anything else I may be doing on the Kindle.  I have tried several other downloadable music sites, and have found Pandora to be the most versatile and have the greatest choice of music as well as being the easiest to use."

"4","Pandora","Five Stars","Mary M Reed","August 16, 2017",5,"I love hearing my favorite tunes."
"5","Pandora","Like it!","Adrienne Englund","February 4, 2013",4,"Panadora is one of my favorite FREE apps.  I use this app all the time when working out, and I love the variety of music they have for free on here!  I just downloaded this to my Kindle as my son loves music and now he can listen to it on the kindle as well!  Other than the ""Pop and Hip Hop Power workout"" station playin OLDIES (not sure why this is) I have no issues and love Pandora!"
"6","Pandora","Pandora is a great app for music play","BRK","November 10, 2015",4,"Pandora is a great app for music play. Upside is that you can create any list you want .... down side is that there is not enough different music added to your selected playlist type."
"7","Pandora","All My Genre","Kludge","September 13, 2013",5,"This is really great sound.What a concept!  Just start a station off and it keeps adding same genre songs.Tired of that genre, start another station off and it keeps building, too.Tomorrow want some of the same, then maybe something different, start another station, or start an old one.Thumbs down those songs you don't want and they are gone.  Thumbs up those to tweak the selections of the future songs.Great deal, and no advertisements.I definitely recommend!"
"8","Pandora","I like the service but find the app not very intuitive ...","Amazon Customer","February 16, 2016",4,"I like the service but find the app not very intuitive in terms of use. Perhaps a link to instructions on how best to set up your own channels would be helpful."
"9","Pandora","The music is great, the commercials are a pain","Norman R","December 10, 2012",3,"I guess that's the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."
"10","Pandora","Five Stars","Rodney Phillips","May 16, 2017",5,"Just love it"
"11","Pandora","Five Stars","Vincent Frese","June 2, 2016",5,"Very good"

"15","Pandora","What happened?","Shannon R.","August 24, 2013",2,"I've only had this app for a week and already problems! Worked like a charm until I had it exactly one week then it refused to load further than the blue Pandora screen! I completely removed it deleted the purchase and downloaded again for it to only do the same thing the next day! I hope this is just a bug that can be worked out because I love Pandora!"
"16","Pandora","Highly Recommended","Mortimer","July 20, 2016",5,"I have been using Pandora Radio for years, I love the stations I have created and I'm always surprised at the song choices they suggest, hidden treasures or forgotten favorites!"

"19","Pandora","Simply Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!","Sukey","November 17, 2012",5,"Pandora app is the best!  If you love music and you simply want some relaxation music or want to get up and dance, Pandora has it all.  The sound on the Kindle Fire HD is simply a knock out.  Cannot believe that sound comes out of that thin piece of amazement!!!!  Truly, I recommend getting the full version of this app.  It is not much and is totally worth it.Thanks to Pandora and amazon.com."
"20","Pandora","Pandora!","Hattsfam","March 29, 2013",5,"I have the free version.  Every now and then it asks if you are still listening and/or you hear a few ads, but I don't find it annoying enough to upgrade and pay monthly for it.  The genre picked does tend to play the same songs over and over, but there are many options to choose from and change the genre playing to change up the songs whenever you want. Can't beat it for free!!??"
"21","Pandora","Good App","Got2bfree","June 3, 2016",4,"Good App"

"26","Pandora","What a waste of","Eric J.","August 1, 2015",1,"Stopped working immediately and had to call Pandora.  Next use was equal to one song at a time. After screwing with it for way too long, just changed to a different streaming program.  What a waste of time"
"27","Pandora","love it","Ida Hudson","January 31, 2013",5,"well you cant go wrong with Pandora in the first place. Awesome music, the lyrics to sing by and easy to use"
"28","Pandora","nothing evil in THIS box!","Bun-Bun Baxter","August 1, 2015",4,"Being able to pick ""stations"" for your favorite music means very little you dislike, though Pandora limits the number of pieces you can skip through, and there are ads unless you pay to avoid them."
"29","Pandora","Five Stars","Mark Cusenz","September 27, 2017",5,"I Love It !!! Listen all day at work, makes the day a whole lot easier !!"
"30","Pandora","I want to stop my subscription","juan","May 23, 2017",1,"I want to cancel the subscription to stop the payment and it won't let me"
"31","Pandora","The internet music standard - for good reason","PghDrake","March 20, 2013",5,"This app has always made advances with internet radio and doesn't disappoint.  It's very rare that there are issues with the app or the connection (as long as you have a good WiFi connection of course).  You can set up your own channels and listen to everything from rock to classical to comedy bits.An excellent app that everyone should have, in my opinion.-D"
"32","Pandora","Love using Pandora","Bethany","November 29, 2016",5,"Love using Pandora. It has great variety and I am able to even hook into it on my cable box."
"33","Pandora","Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like","Amazon Customer","March 10, 2016",3,"Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like. The only problem is it has loading problems. It can take a long time to start the next song."

Now that I have a mini Bose blue tooth speaker it's even better.I listen tall all my favorite channels at home and now at work.I have the premium Pandora with no commercials.

"41","Pandora","Ads cost Pandora a !!!","Amazon Customer","November 22, 2016",4,"Four stars because of advertising, would be better without ads and no charge to remove them !"
"42","Pandora","Very Nice","suitedzombie","November 15, 2015",4,"Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can't get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it's the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. :)"
"43","Pandora","Works But Nothing is Free","Amazon Customer","October 22, 2015",2,"You don't get something for nothing.  This works but I've read that it enables personal information to be sent to the company about your habits, contacts, pictures, etc.  I took it off."
"44","Pandora","love it","Amazon Customer","February 27, 2014",4,"Awesome app. Really wish the kindle version didn't take off the sleep timer though. I miss that feature, can't fall asleep to the music anymore because I have to wake up to turn it off. Sigh. Other than that I love this for everything else. Music is in everything I breathe and Pandora almost always plays my moods."
"45","Pandora","Five Stars","Lannette","July 18, 2017",5,"I love me some PANDORA would not change for anything unless it's better."
"46","Pandora","Wonderful!!!","Ardie","April 16, 2014",5,"So enjoy the variety and easy of use.  I carry it with me and it helps me keep working. Thanks!!!!"
"47","Pandora","went wrong since last update -.-","Amazon Customer","November 3, 2015",2,"Last update does not allow you to stop playing your music, stop playing, skip a song, nor like or dislike it unless you are inside the app. Plus it stops playing by itself randomely."
"48","Pandora","One Star","broron","July 18, 2017",1,"Don't know they would not except my account."
"49","Pandora","Five Stars","Amazon Customer","August 24, 2017",5,"Good"
"50","Pandora","Pandora is awesome. It is free music","Trey","April 7, 2015",4,"Pandora is awesome. It is free music. Type in a song, album or artist and you get that plus similar music. And its all for free? I use it for Moon Hooch and Mickey Avalon radio. Better than radio, satellite and Youtube for music."
"51","Pandora","The app does what it is meant to do","Benjamin Thomas Rath","February 25, 2015",4,"The app does what it is meant to, open a direct link to your Pandora account. It doesn't do anything else because it doesn't have too. You could accomplish the same effect by creating a short cut, but I find this slightly more convenient."
"52","Pandora","1st app","Reader in the Midwest","July 14, 2013",5,"This was my 1st app on my new KFHD & I love it. The device has good speakers & w/Pandora you can program your favorites. Wish there were no audio ads but the app was free so why complain?! I had to go to Amazon's Kindle support to figure out where it was on my KFHD once I downloaded it but that's not the fault of the app. Pleased to have it & esp at no cost."
"53","Pandora","pandora","Nancy Weimer","August 29, 2013",5,"I love the pandora.  It's easy to use and works great.  I would yell anyone that ask me that they will love it."

"55","Pandora","Really enjoyed the new app","William","September 17, 2015",5,"Really enjoyed the new app, as my wife has been using Pandora for years now.  I love the various categories of music which allows you to play tailor towards your favorites.  I waited too long."
"56","Pandora","Pandora is amazing -- a huge value in my life!","Andrew Cohen","January 1, 2015",5,"I love their service of providing super music all the time.  I love these dedicated stations of mine.  The three main ones are early classical (when I'm working), piano jazz when I'm doing light tasks and driving, and classical guitar while dining."
"57","Pandora","Great music","Amazon Customer","September 13, 2016",5,"Constant good music, always accessible, for all occasions! Makes it enjoyable to listen all day a and night."
"58","Pandora","I liked the music but it took over my phone and ...","Marlenia P.","April 8, 2016",2,"I liked the music but it took over my phone and would not let me turn it off. I had to contact mayday to fix it, then I removed it from my phone."
"59","Pandora","One Star","Amazon Customer","May 2, 2017",1,"Not available in South Africa, such a pity!"
"60","Pandora","commercials","Tom M.","March 28, 2014",4,"Music is great, but nothing in life is free. A few to many commercials. Some times I struggle to find stop button. They call it quit"
"61","Pandora","Pandora on Kindle is a great combination.","Bryan C Seymour","December 9, 2013",5,"Pandora has become my go to place to experience new music. I'm still old school enough to find an artist I like and then buy the CD (soon I'll be buying the vinyl). The Pandora app runs great on my Kindle Fire, so now I find myself doing more ""music research"" when laying in bed before I turn the lights out for the night."
"62","Pandora","I love it","Linda K.","January 31, 2017",5,"Although I basicly stay on one channel it is awesome, they always play the best songs"
"63","Pandora","I enjoy listening to the mix of music that happens as ...","Whits End","December 31, 2014",5,"I enjoy listening to the mix of music that happens as Pandora interprets my likes and dislikes.  It is very easy to use, easy to pick your own type of music, and easy to say 'I don't like that' when something is introduced that grates on my nerves."
"64","Pandora","Not as good","Dennis M. Philpot","December 29, 2016",3,"It used to be a lot better.  They still play good music but have too many commercials"
"65","Pandora","Four Stars","Marvin R.","January 7, 2017",4,"I guess after you get good with it, it may be good. Until then it is quite difficult."
"66","Pandora","Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many ...","Josh","September 5, 2016",2,"Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many songs you could skip during the whole day and shoved a commercial down your throat every other song. There's way better options out there."
"67","Pandora","Five Stars","Emmanuel Dada","June 3, 2016",5,"Great"
"68","Pandora","Great Music, more choices,","Charlotte Ragan","December 7, 2013",5,"It works for me.  I love it.  I live in an apartment building and my neighbors say they hear Pandora coming from my apt. and love the music.  Some also use it.  I'm 66 years old and find it difficult to listen to my car radio.  There is less music on the car radio then ever before.  I like having choices and with Pandora you do."
"69","Pandora","Freedom to listen to the songs you really love","Sunflower","January 28, 2014",5,"I like that I can select the songs and artists that I like to listen to, and I can give songs it ads that are similar a thumbs up or down.  Also I can listen to Pandora while I play games on my Kindle fire. Thanks to my grandson for telling me about Pandora as he also uses it, and he showed me how to use it.  Love it."
"70","Pandora","Awesome customizability yall","Amazon Customer","July 7, 2016",5,"Love this app.  I know its been around for years now but I just decided to check it out.  Love customizing my own stations."
"71","Pandora","Pandora service","Little Al","April 1, 2014",4,"I enjoyed using this program until they raised the price of the service. It is a one of a kind program  because I could develope the music folks I listen to most offen. Now I just stream the general music I like. The Pandora music program is still free to use but with advertising coming on every so often."
"72","Pandora","Love it!","neffy","October 9, 2013",5,"I didn't realize how much I would enjoy the Pandora app. I carry my Kindle from room to room or out on the porch and have constant, great music that I like. No more tuning in a radio. Really like that it identifies the artist - there are songs I've heard before but didn't know who was singing. Just this app alone makes the Kindle worth it!"
"73","Pandora","This is a really good product.","Louise Bishop","June 8, 2013",4,"I like this very much.  Its a little hard to figure out how to work it.  Are there any instructions?  Don't know where they are.  But the fact is once you get it started, its really terrific.  The music fits my choices exactly.  They know what I like better than I do. Very enjoyable on my Kindle Fire. Nice to make good use of really good sound on the Kindle Fire."
"74","Pandora","Broken app no longer!","Pat Krave","August 8, 2015",5,"Thank you for fixing.  We are going back to 5 stars.  PANDORA!!!  Have you even noticed the comments since your last update?  Hope you are working on a fix.  Thanks for bringing me music before that."
"75","Pandora","Four Stars","Amazon Customer","January 7, 2017",4,"love it so far, still trying to learn what it can do and understand how to do things"
"76","Pandora","Best music station ever","Devin","July 22, 2015",5,"I Downloaded Pandora on my Kindle and instantly fell In love. I work on the beach and this is my go to app for music from every genre. I love how it let's you create your own station. At anytime you can pick up my Kindle and Pandora will be on."
"77","Pandora","Da BEST!!!!","$LeAira$","December 31, 2015",5,"This is my favorite music app everrrrr I use it all the time,  LITTERALLY.  😃 I recommend this app for anyone looking for a free,  good working,  efficient app!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

I recently discovered Pandora and was very pleased with the site. I e;njoyed exploring Pandora and setting up ""stations"" for future listening. I am most impressed with the classical selections on Pandora. I know I will come back to the site over and over to see what's new."
"79","Pandora","It was absolutely amazing and so enjoyable","Berniece SKinner","November 5, 2015",5,"We listened to Pandora all the way from Oregon to Palm Springs instead of Sirius.  It was absolutely amazing and so enjoyable.  And let's not forget how much less expensive it is."

"83","Pandora","Pandora is a great app, although I prefer I Heart Radio, as it doesn't need Wi-Fi.","Leifur Castle","January 27, 2016",5,"Pandora is a great app, although I prefer I Heart Radio, as it doesn't need Wi-Fi.  I am able to create stations and playlists of my favorite music, which allows me to simply click on my favorite Irish playlists, and hear my favorite drinking songs!  I love this app!"
"84","Pandora","Five Stars","Amazon Customer","August 22, 2017",5,"So far so good with setting up, selecting, and playing."
"85","Pandora","short amount of time","Vicki hartman","January 1, 2014",5,"In the short amount of time I spent on Pandora the first time, I was able to find a mess of songs and artists that I enjoy.  Now I just need the time to go back for more.  I couldn't find my favorite Christmas CD at home, but found some pleasant music to listen to on a very snowy holiday complete with a crackling fire !!!"
"86","Pandora","Pandora will not allow me to get in.","Amazon Customer","May 23, 2017",1,"Says ""unable to play music"" ALL the time.  Vary disappointed."
"87","Pandora","Good stuff","jw","November 20, 2015",5,"I live this .. I don't listen to the radio very much but this is wonderful to have. I can determine what will be my regular songs & what will be the songs I don't want to hear"
"88","Pandora","Love, love","Phred Phlintstone","August 5, 2016",5,"Love, love, love having someone else choose music for me. I pick a style I want to hear, and Pandora does the rest."
"89","Pandora","Pandora application for Kindle","Bill Phillips","March 24, 2013",5,"One of the main reasons for buying my Kindle Fire was so I could listen to Pandora in my house through my stereo and also out in my shop through another stereo. It works very well. It is not quite as user friendly as the one on my Macbook but I think with a little time I will learn new tricks and shortcuts. I am very happy with it overall and very grateful to get it for free."
"90","Pandora","All you need.","Frenchie ..thats all you get","September 13, 2016",5,"Almost anything you want. Even ...Mother's of Invention...best part.. No messing around start it ,it plays"
"91","Pandora","Good buy","Eldon","September 6, 2017",4,"Avail on many devices. Good selection of stations. Easy access. So far no problems."
"92","Pandora","Overall","Jan Morrow","September 11, 2017",4,"Overall - Great.  Could use a little more material.  Start to hear several repeats."
"93","Pandora","Too many ads","adpanda","August 3, 2015",3,"Good music, like being able to select favorites and skip songs, but the ads are loud and annoying. I use this to play lullabies to my daughter and inevitably a commercial will come on and wake her up."
"94","Pandora","Five Stars","BJR","January 3, 2015",5,"Really happy with this app.  Add stations then shuffle, couldn't be easier to customize the music."
"95","Pandora","Five Stars","Takisha","December 2, 2016",5,"I enjoy having music that I create playlist stations for at my disposal. Love this app!"
"96","Pandora","Great app","michelle mogavero","April 16, 2015",5,"Awesome app. Free version works great. If you don't mind the commercials every now and then, I see no reason to purchase the paid version. Great for getting to know similar or new bands that relate to bands you already know."
"97","Pandora","good games or not","the AWESOME GAME EVER","December 26, 2015",5,"This is technically an app but this is amazing if you like music and if you're always busy and want to listen to music when you're doing something.... I LOVE THIS APP"
"98","Pandora","Love it","Lovely Day","September 4, 2017",5,"Love the selection of music"
"99","Pandora","Five Stars","Amazon Customer","May 4, 2017",5,"excellent music. use a lot."
"100","Pandora","not what I expected","F. J. Goslin","May 9, 2014",2,"I'm sorry that I couldn't make this any better but it doesn't do what I thought it was supposed to do. I wanted to make a play list with an artist. But all this would do is play one selection by the artist and then it started playing other artists that I never heard of...not for me any longer..."
"101","Pandora","Like Pandora BUT..........","Amazon Customer","March 7, 2014",3,"I have had a Pandora account for a longtime but had not used it in quite a while.  When I downloaded it on my new Droid XX, I found it very annoying because the ads out number the music.  I found the monthly fee to avoid the ads to be twice as high as it should be.  In the past I paid $15 for a subscription."
"102","Pandora","Great site!","Elias Hane","January 18, 2013",4,"Great site with extended and complete information about songs and artist.Unfortunetly too much advertisment, but the service is excellent."

"104","Pandora","Pandora Music App","Brian Clausen","March 18, 2014",5,"This is an awesome App to purchase if you are looking for a music App that learns as you check whether you like the song it plays at the time. You can create individual band name folders and click thumbs up or thumbs down to make your selection for that individual band you have named each folder you are listening to. It learns as you make your selections and narrows the music it plays until it eventually plays nothing but the band name you picked for each folder. If you want to narrow your search even more you can create folders for specific album names for the band you select. I very highly recommend this App."
"105","Pandora","Replaces XM radio","Buk Wyrm","March 16, 2014",5,"This service replaces my XM radio. Preferring to go ad less I have tried the 1 month free trial and will continue based on my experience so far . I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm."
"106","Pandora","Love pandora!!!!","Katrinka Rosado","April 17, 2014",5,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to Pandora. I can listen to any of my favorite artists anytime, anyplace day or night. It is such a great way to carry my favorite music with me anywhere. Get on board. Its' a must have.!!"

"110","Pandora","One good and free app from Amazon Market for BB 10","Sambosia","November 5, 2014",4,"I used to have Apollo (Pandora Radio Client) on my Blackberry playbook and got used to it especially it got no advertisement.  Now with Pandora I got the same good music but ads are there.  It works great on my Blackberry Passport and I highly recommend it."

"113","Pandora","PANDORA APP for polaroid tablet","Amazon Customer","December 1, 2012",1,"I use this app on all my devices and I bought a polaroid 8 in tablet for both of my children for christmas.  I decided to open one to test it out and this app doesn't work.  It loads but never plays the music. It just constantly changes the song and never plays.

It works fabulously."
"123","Pandora","Glitchy on the Kindle Fire HD...","P. Hartung","April 22, 2013",3,"Love pandora as a service and use across other devices as well, but this app needs to be smoothed out for the kindle fire HD.  It often won't shut off (or become mute) when closing the cover, and it also hampers the use of other apps while running simultaneously.It's free, and I trust they'll work out the flaws eventually.  Until then it gets three stars..."

How else would you get this great music app for free?"
"135","Pandora","Perfect","Stephanie","March 19, 2014",5,"I love Pandora as i can customize my own station.

The reason for only 3 stars is that I have it installed on my phone, and sometimes it kicks on by itself.  It doesn't matter if I'm at work, or school or in the middle of the night.  I won't be using my phone and all of a sudden I start hearing music. Since I always have my volume up so I can hear my phone, when Pandora comes on, it is loud!  If that were fixed so it wouldn't randomly start playing, I would give it 5 stars."

"260","Pandora","Not as useful as I'd hoped it would be","Liz","May 9, 2014",3,"This app is fast, easy to use, and intuitive. The layout is very similar to that of the iOS version on the iPhone. My only issue is that when I'm out I'm more likely to have my phone on me so I use the app on my phone. When I'm at home I'm more likely to use Pandora on my computer because it's easier. So I very rarely seem to be able to find much use for Pandora on my Kindle. Additionally, my Kindle relies on wi-fi so when I'm out if I have no wi-fi access then the app is basically useless so I go back to my phone anyway. For me, personally, this app doesn't get much use on the Kindle."

I recently added another station for straight-ahead Latin jazz (e.g., Chucho Valdes, Dave Valentin, etc.), and the stuff they include is always very good."

I've got it on my phone, my tablet, the laptop and the desktop!! I shuffle my playlist and that's all I need to do.  I plan to cancel my Netflix subscription since I really don't use it as often as I've been using Pandora and subscribe to Pandora to get rid of the commercials ( they're not bad but I just prefer to be commercial free)"
"282","Pandora","Pandora Review (free version)","WR450f_09","October 31, 2013",4,"Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they're getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now, listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2-3 songs - but hey it's free so I can't dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it wouldn't hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One (paid version), but the thought has crossed my mind since it's only a measly $3 per month ($36/year). This version eliminates all commercials.Pros:-free-offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in-there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations-easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button-they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes-if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a whileCons:-commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded-not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station, you hear the same tracks if you're a daily listener-rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes (e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you're listening to, then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that's all you want to hear), but the more you rate the better it fixes itselfOverall Recommendation:If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the $3 if there was a guarantee for better variety, but until then I'm satisfied with the free version and who knows, maybe that's why I'm shopping at Home Depot more as of late..."

"541","Pandora","it WAS awesome...","Fizzle Exmortus","April 7, 2013",4,"ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWCurrent version still has a great selection and variety and almost no bugs.  You have to register via email to use it now and It now has double the ads and they come in audio AND video form, usually in pairs or threes.  Recently they removed the previously added time limit of a few hours a month.  This means that, although you are still limited to a half dozen skips a day, you can at least listen to a station or change stations for as long as you want.  This change made it regain a previously lost star and caused me to re-download it.  They also added a feature to share the song on your registered pandora profile, facebook, and twitter.  You still won't get that perfect song in one go, but you won't run out of time waiting for it to queue up. It's still 3.99 for unlimited ad free music. I can't give it the full 5 stars because of the amount of Ads (I understand they have to do so to provide music for free, but they are going overboard) and the need to email register an account with them (sketchy stuff that often leads to notif and junk spamming), but it has definitely earned at least one more star for getting rid of that time limit.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys music and doesn't mind sitting through less favorite songs and ads to hear their top picks (like we used to do with the radio, before lime wire and kazaa)ORIGINAL REVIEW:It has a great selection and variety, almost no bugs, and tolerable ads.  However, recently they added a time limit that is only a few hours a month!  I could see an hour a day, but if you listen as often as I do, this means you can only use the app within the first few days of a month. First week, tops.  This would make it acceptable for people who only listen for a song every now and then, but you still only get 6 skips an hour per station, so you won't get that perfect song in one go, and if you wait to hear it you'll run out of time for the month.  Of course you can buy the 3.99 app and pay for unlimited ad free music or even pay .99 when your times up to keep listening for the month, but let's face it, this app was used too much without enough revenue so they are gonna force us to pay or suffer. Meanwhile, I'll be finding a new app."

I've tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly.  I don't want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that's exactly what this provides.  Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune.I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data  that this doesn't use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data.  There are a ton of visual advertisements!!!  But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I don't see them.  I don't know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior."

AOL radio doesn't work more than half the time and I have gotten an on screen message several times saying to try again later, when I do, still nothing.

However when I walked away and returned, the station was no longer functioning. Turns out that the ap requires you to interact with it from time to time or it shuts down the station. This stinks!

I was a satellite radio fan until I moved to where I could not install the antenna properly to receive it. I was waiting for the right time to compile an MP3 collection, for years. But I was always more in love with the spontaneity of radio. You know something is really one of your favorite things if the only regret you have with it is why hadn't I discovered it sooner. I could have had so much more fun and so many less boring drives and so many less years of wondering when I was going to have the time and money to develop an extensive MP3 collection that would be able to come anywhere close to the # of my favorite songs that exist in the world. The thumbs up/thumbs down feature really is what you should pay attention to, because that is what really personalizes the station for you. You will be surprised how many new artists/songs that you might like that you may never have heard otherwise. I didn't even know i was interested in new artists until their style so logically followed my other old favorite styles of songs & artists. It's an ingenious system. So fun, so little work"

The continous music with a commercial advertisement is still better than FM Radio in my local area.I can not upgrade app to latest upgrade for some strange reason."
"1368","Pandora","Pandora V.S Spotify","Oscar Cruz","March 18, 2015",3,"I think Pandora is a great app! Pandora has all the music you would want but, there is no playlists or personal music. In spotify you can create radio channels, you get recommended music, you can go to different genres of music and find specific music that you would enjoy. You can also save music to your own playlists and listen to it anywhere for free with no internet!"

"1373","Pandora","Pandora is user friendly","Ann","July 19, 2016",5,"I've been using Pandora for 7 months. I've tried others, but the reason I like Pandora so much is my ability to tell it what kind of music I want to listen to....Some may say another internet radio station does that....well, if they do, they are user friendly enough for me to figure it out."

"1375","Pandora","After the love has gone....","Dominique Tate","January 18, 2014",2,"When you first meet Pandora, you get a light headed feeling.  You think to yourself, ""Wow, finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of.  You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact.  You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you'd get introduced to.  You mess around with different combinations of songs, artists, themes, etc, until you realize something strange is happening!  You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true?  Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop, where all the music you clicked ""like"" to is constantly being played, even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on?  You start to panic and say, ""Well maybe the ""free"" version has limitations.  So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together.  You take the plunge--pull out your credit card and go for broke, only to be deflated, dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self-pity and regret.  Why? Why Pandora Why?"

"1382","Pandora","Music app not what I would use again","Len J.","March 18, 2016",3,"I understand developers want money. It's business. What I want is some reasonable privacy when I run an app. I like music. There are FREE apps that do a nice job, some with too many ads but many that certainly don't need my email address or login to operate. Pandora isn't one of these. It might well be a premium music app but in terms of what it wants... it's not for me.Slick interface that installs smoothly and runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. Fast download took forever to install. Why? TUNE IN is just as effective, annoyingly too many intrusive ads, but free and no login required."

"1391","Pandora","A little more annoying then useful","Tm","March 27, 2014",3,"I wanted to be able to make my own personalized music experience, but end up skipping around a bunch to get to a decent song, or just going to Youtube instead. It seems when I choose an artist for a channel, that artist gets played like once a day. Sometimes I get music I don't like and that aren't even close to the channels artist, and when I down vote them I keep getting more of their songs. The ads are annoying too, to say the least. It could be much better, but they have to pay their bills somehow. I will from now on just buy my own songs instead.Pros: free music, a variety of music, introduces you to new songs or artists you may like.Cons: very limited, not very big on custom tuning the channels to your preference, intrusive ads every other song, irrelevant songs often."

Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

The selection and variety of music though is really nice and I suppose I could pay and have those annoying ads removed, but the ads themselves really dont bother me.  Just how loud they are.  I read one time that increased volume on ads supposedly increases their effectiveness which is why television ads are required to fall within a certain volume level.Perhaps it is more jarringly noticeable because I am playing soft lullabies.  That is my only complaint though and use this free app a lot without it freezing or having bugs."

This app is great for the whole family! My kids (12, 10, 4 & 2) all love music and use this app frequently. It's easy to use and easy to change stations so even my 2 year old knows how to turn on his favorite Disney music. There are unlimited stations to search for so anything the kids want to hear they can find very easily. We even have different profiles set on each device so we can monitor what the kids can or cannot listen to, I love the parental controls so I don't have to worry about my  kids listening to bad music. We love everything about Pandora and will always use this app!!!"

(I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.)I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything.  I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer.  I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened.  I assumed the battery was drained.  I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else.  I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes.  Then I tried opening it.  Nothing.  I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime.  I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared.  The indicator said 64% charged, so it had some charge the whole time.I tried unlocking the Kindle.  Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared.  I entered my PIN, nothing.  Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked.  I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora.  I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal.  I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network.  I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books."

But the stations you can make up and you can add other artist to the stations you can make up is pretty awesome. I have the Neighbourhood radio station. Do you that I added Calvin Harris.

When that expired, I cancelled again.When I received a free subscription to Pandora, I accepted.  Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires.Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about &4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract.I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost,since I have the free version, but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service"

After you listen for a while it pauses, and then asks do you want to continue.  This is a real pain, as I am capable to telling the stupid site when I am done listening, and do not need them to baby sit me.  This is why I consider it only average."
"2534","Pandora","Pandora One upgrade? More like Pandora NONE!","Amazon Customer","April 25, 2014",1,"Almost immediately after i upgraded to ad-free pandora one, i started getting error messages. (never received an error message before upgrading)it got continuously worse, sometimes shutting down the app completely, other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing.I tried to reach them -they have NO PHONE NUMBER-i emailed them, per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them.I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for, especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non-paying customer.  I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already, but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet, because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they'd never delivered. Granted it was only 4 or 5 dollars at that point, but i don't have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they didn't deserve that money@all.Long story short - i am busy and before too long, some other nightmare in my life took center stage, and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email, until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day!aarrgghhh!!!!!!so, thanks alot Pandora for your upgraded product, PANDORA NONE!p.s. get a freaking phone number with the money you charged me without delivering a product."

"2615","Pandora","Good, could be great","vinnyf","March 11, 2017",4,"Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to ""normalize"" the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few ""deep tracks"", just the same old popular cuts.But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"

It is easy to use and plays what I like a majority of the time. I will say: UPGRADE TO PANDORA ONE. Commercial free, it is SO worth it.

I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe shouldn't hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons (thumbs) or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it's great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to itIn... say d flat major"

Within the first 15 minutes, this app had somehow determined what type of musing I like and what other artists I might enjoy.  I was hooked instantly.  When they say you never hear a song you DON'T LIKE, they mean it. The more you rate, the more tailored your listening experience becomes. I LOVE/LIVE music......this app meets my standards! Love it."

By simply liking, disliking or skipping songs played on your radio station, Pandora deciders the type of music you're looking for.It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour, which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device.I've found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online.One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can't seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first, which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off...Everything else is fantastic."

You can create multiple 'stations' that play what you want to hear by selecting a few artists or songs that you like, then the app will choose other songs that fit that style.  They have spent a tremendous amount of time categorizing and analyzing every song that plays, noting the rhythm, chord structure, key, tempo, harmonics, instrumentation, etc.  By analyzing the songs you pick, it can then go to its library and find songs that match similar features.I don't believe it will play every song on a given album/CD though.  There must be certain tracks that the record label allows them to play.  To hear the rest, you have to buy the album of course.  ;-)"

However, there are 2 problems with the app that I have.First of all, the app used to display the song and artist as well as a pause button in the drop down tool bar on the Kindle Fire. It would be nice to have that back. This way I don't need to be in Pandora to see what song or artist it is.Second, when the stations are on shuffle, it doesn't say which station the song currently playing is coming from. This is a problem because I can't like or dislike songs for fear of them being on the wrong station.Other than thos  two complaints,the Pandora app is awesome!"

It works great, but be warned that there are way more (visual) ads on the tablet than on the PC version. At least, that's the way that it seems, but perhaps this has something to do with the much smaller screen. I can certainly forgive these ads, however, since the radio stations that Pandora creates for me are so fun to listen to, and they need to make their money some way. If I grow tired of the ads, I can always upgrade my Pandora account, so as to eliminate them for a fee. However, I don't spend that much time even looking at the tablet when this app is in use- and as a nice bonus, the display darkens after the app has been running for some time, so as to conserve battery power (the speakers will still play the music, of course, and the app continues to run)."

It's a good starting place to get basic info about the composer and musician(s). Some of the choices will even inspire to shell out the cash for a more permanent option.The free version is financed by ads, but they are not too oppressive, and, after all, this is primarily a music outlet. However, when the audio ads come on, pressing the Mute button for a 5-count of ""Mississippi One..."" takes care of that."

You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."

The staff went without pay for a time early on until Pandora received their first round of venture funding.

"3880","Pandora","I enjoyed it from start to finish","Jo Elin DuBois","November 25, 2014",5,"If this is a referral for Pandora by Anne Rice, then I definitely give it 5 stars.  Pandora describes the life of a Roman woman of the upper class 2000 years ago.  It is thorough in her descriptions both of women and and the soldiers of Caesar's armies. I enjoyed it from start to finish.  Pandora is one of Anne's vampire books but like all her vampire books, the characters are much more than just vampires and she develops them so that the reader sees them as human as well as vampire with the human still dominating their lives as they struggle with their new identities."

One word of caution - even though it may say ""music for work"" be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity.  It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting.  I would not use ""music for work"" if it was an educational setting even in an office.  But that's just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down.  Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to."

I have found new songs and new artists I like now due to this app.  However, there are a few problems:40 hour limit: for mobile devices, you get 40 hours of music per week.  That's a little over 5 hours per day, which is good if you don't listen to as much as I do (I'm almost constantly listening to music)Ads: not too bad, the limit is what gets me.  What annoys me a little, however is that I think the ads are included in your limit.Sure, they give a couple good solutions.  The first option is to pay a dollar for unlimited music, but that's just for a month.  Second is Pandora One, which is the dollars a month if I remember right.  If you have access to a computer, that's the best option in my opinion.  However, getting it on mobile is also nice for when a computer isn't on and ready."

I really love that I can have my kindle charging and have pandora play while my kindle is turned off (not powered off, just the screen) and it'll still charge and play the music!The only problem I have with this app (and why it's not five stars) is that sometimes when I closed the app, it'll start up the app again (causing it to switch out what I'm doing to pandora). I found that I couldn't just leave the app, I had to actually hit the menu button (on the upper right corner) to quit so that it would stay closed.Other than that, I found no faults and would definitely recommend this free app to anyone!"

Also, I listen to it at work and if you don't ""Like"" or ""Dislike"" evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ""ARE YOU THERE, WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE DON'T LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM""  what the ????I mean really?  They pay?  No we pay and to pause our music just to get us to stop our WORK to answer inorder to listen kind of buggs me.  But again the music is good and I do like the app."

You can make your favorite channel by picking your favorite song, your favorite artist, your favorite genre or just add the already made channels by Pandora. You can also give each song you hear a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down"" which helps to train the station to play what you like. If a particular song comes on and you don't feel like listening to it, you can move ahead to the next song.It really gives a good mix of music and I really enjoy listening to it.I have found this app to be quite reliable. I never seem to have a problem with it crashing.I have it downloaded to my phone and tablet. In the car, I hook up the phone to the car's speakers before I leave the parking lot and using my 4G, I listen to Pandora as I drive around. It is so much better than listening to local radio that plays whatever it wants instead of what I want.I am very happy with this app!"

Inspector is becoming like my friend after reading the third in series.  I have learned a great deal about the Canadian countryside, the people,  their delicious foods, their habits and their individual characters.  I love the Chief Inspector's homicide team and their loyalty to Inspector Gamache.  Each book has featured a victim murdered in a totally different way under mysterious circumstances. It is fun to see how the inspector finds his ""man"". I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.  I think it is best to read the books in order.."

I have appreciated the fact that the advertising on the app is not all intrusive, but is displayed in a small box in the center while the music plays on.My only negative, is that my music choice while enjoyable will tend to repeat itself more frequently after listening for a few days. The variety is limited and repetitive because it is free, but otherwise it is a pleasure to listen to Pandora. I believe it is worthwhile to invest in the paid version which offers more choices to those who can afford it."

Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows  what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, (80's rock). I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it's free with small pop-up ads, or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!"

It takes at least five minutes to load a song, something I thought was a fluke when I first installed it on the Fire tv but seems to be literally every time.

"4872","Pandora","Great source for free music","Yasmin","September 15, 2013",5,"Pros:I love Pandora because it is pretty much like a radio and an MP3 Player combined in the sense that,you can choose your favorite songs,singers,rappers,or bands and the radio will give you their stations along with similar music related to what you chose.For example,if you type into the search engine,Brittney Spears,then her songs will show up with the new Britney Spears station you created and they will also add some songs from a similar artist like Cristina Aguilera,etc.I like this because you can learn new songs from many different artists.Pandora is really great at blending similar song styles.You can share the song or station you are listening to on facebook or twitter also.You are also allowed to skip a song you don't like by either pressing the skip icon or the dislike icon.The songs also comes with biography info about the artist/artists and the lyrics to each song as well as the album name.FREE.Cons:Since Pandora is free and they pay for licenses to the songs,you are only allowed five or six skips a day.Afterwards,you can either stick it out or just change the station to something else.Pandora seems to only have certain songs from different artists not ALL their songs so even if you were to type in ""Count on Me"" by Bruno Mars for example into the search engine,it may just give you a different Bruno Mars song or a song like the one you requested but by a different artist altogether.Also,you cannot REWIND,FAST FORWARD,or REPLAY a song at all and I think that goes back to the fact that they have to pay for it.And,if you type in a song you just recently listened to and try to hear it again,for some reason it doesn't let you.Summary: Pandora is a free radio station app where you can find your favorite songs and artists simply by typing their names into a search engine.You can always edit,meaning you can delete or add stations and it is a great way to learn new songs.While the skips are limited to five or six a day,each song provides you with lyrics and background information on the artist.You can always share what you are listening to on Facebook,Twitter,etc to let friends and family know but just remember you cannot replay a song so wait a bit to try to find it in the search engine.If you hit the like icon on a song,that particular song is more likely to show back up quicker so you wont have to wait long for it but just remember that you cannot rewind or fast forward,you can only PAUSE.Pandora is completely Iphone compatible and even pauses itself when you get an incoming phone call so you can always go back and resume a song when you are done talking.On the Kindle Fire,Pandora shows up nice and big on the screen which will help you to read the lyrics better!In all,Pandora is a amazing app to get for any device that is capable of having it and is the best music app created!!"

"5155","Pandora","Typical of most Amazon Apps","Anahita","July 18, 2013",2,"I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME ""New Age"" music.  I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it.  The Kindle, that is.  However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right.  Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers:  the App is advertised as ""free"", which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid.  Pandora is advertised as free:  download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE.  Not so, of course:  if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements.  If I liked rock-n-roll, it wouldn't be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever.  Ads pop up all over the place.  You can't see the album covers for ads.  Oh, but wait:  just pay the price, and the ads will go away!  The price, by the way--at this point--isn't that bad.  What I resent is that (1) the ""station"" created by Pandora for my liking doesn't play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and (2) I wasn't told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay.  I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle.  The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words.  The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer isn't warned about ahead of time.  As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that doesn't break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads."

"5359","Pandora","Pandora is not a free service!","Jim Gordon","July 7, 2013",5,"The app itself works farily well and has most features you would want. Pandora is never free! You either pay $36/yr for Pandora One with no commercials on the screen or audio, or you pay with your loss of time, self dignity and sanity by allowing Pandora to force feed you audio and video ads between songs. Far from free. Yes, I know millions of Americans have been conditioned to tolerate intrusive advertising in their daily life but there is a cost to you. It has conditioned you to make compromises in your quality of life for no legitimate reason, just the corporate greed trying to leach upon your every moment of the day. Don't let them do it. The 'free' Pandora is a preview service only for your introduction to the concept. Pay the $36/yr for Pandora One, sending a clear message you value your time and dignity too much to be force fed advertisments. Reviews here keep saying there is no way to turn it off but on my Kindle Fire HD there are at least 3 ways I came across with only a minute's effort. You can hit the pause button during a song to stop it. You can explore the icons on the screen and find several ways to log off. Of course this means you must re-enter your email and password later so I just hit the pause button. If you don't like the occasional prompts that ask if you are still there, send the following message to Pandora Customer Support: ""I don't care what you pay in royalties, just charge us what you must to provide completely uninterrupted service like other services and satellite radio offers.""  Take charge of your technology, don't let your technology take charge of you!"

I was looking for an all-in-one app (something like iTunes-but they dont make iTunes for my device), and this one came closest to the mark.You can listen three ways:--Upload all your own music--Purchase music from Pandora--Listen to unlimited, free music in the form of ""radio stations""The feature I like the most is the Radio Station ""maker"". You can make custom lists of songs that Pandora will play in sequence, and it does NOT have to be music you already own or have to buy.For example, if you like a specific genre of music, you can choose that search feature, Pandora will go out and grab music that falls into the category and make you a radio station of it. If it brings in a song you dislike-you click on  ""skip"" button and it will be discarded from your station.You can also rate songs so the app will learn what interests you.You can make other radio stations (and keep the many different stations you make in a library) by using your own music or by combining yours with Pandora's.You can make radio stations of a single band, specific genre's, or many other different ways.It's a great app to find music you are thinking about purchasing and listen to all of it first, or to find music you haven't heard yet from a band you love, and even find other bands you've never heard before based on music you like.The app comes in a free, ad-based version (the ad's are NOT annoying and relentless), or you can get a paid app. The one I use is the free one, and you barely notice the ad's and infrequent short commercials.Great music listening software!"

I've learned of lots of performers I didn't know before that are a lot like my favorites. Most of the time it chooses well, but if it doesn't I can unlike that track and the program learns better what I do like. It's a great alternative to regular radio stations because I don't like commercials or annoying DJ's.After signing up for a month of Pandora, I've decided to opt for a whole year so I won't be without it."

With the Kindle Fire, the songs stream smoothly. If you're not familiar with Pandora, it is a program that allows you to choose the type of music you want to hear.  I started with a favorite musician and put that name in my ""Station"".  After that song ended, Pandora played a song from another artist of that genre.  If I gave the song a thumbs up, the song continued and more of the new artist's songs would eventually be played on my ""station.""  If I gave it a thumbs down, the song immediately stopped playing and Pandora went on to another artist and another song. I now have several ""stations"" -- one for relaxation music, one for blues, one for classical, one for country, etc.  Pandora works great with Kindle Fire... Of course, the sound system isn't a Bose, so if your a musical purist, you shouldn't expect great surround sound.I really don't see how anyone can go wrong with downloading and using Pandora."

I like the fact that you can select artists and they create a whole station around them and artists that are similar. Their picks for extra artists are generally very good--many artists I like are already included with others I've chosen.

There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to.  If you don't Pandora just stops, doesn't play any more music, but stays open.  There isn't any way to skip or pause the music unless you, once again, physically open the app.  You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu.  There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song.  The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone, iPod or laptop versions."

It works if you turn it off and leave it alone for an hour, but if you fiddle with it in the slightest way, the next track won't play. This is just sh*tty and weird from my experience. Oh, wait.

I would use it more if I didn't have a pay service, but there are a couple of things I am not crazy about:  1) Ads, but nothing you can do about that; and 2) when I select an artist to start with, it seems they don't play very much from that artist, and the number of other artists they play is very limited.  For example, I ask for a station to begin with Rush, and I'll hear a Rush song to start with, but not again for 30-45 minutes.  In the meantime, I'll hear a couple of songs from Led Zeppelin, a couple from the Rolling Stones, and maybe 2 or 3 more artists, and no others.  So maybe this app is not for me."

The commercial breaks aren't that long, and they aren't ridiculously frequent. You can control exactly what kind of music you listen to, and there's no limit on how many channels you can have. There's the skip button for when you hear a track way too often, although there is a limit on how many times you can use that. Of course, there's always the alternative (and unlimited) way to skip a song: just change stations. All in all, I can't think of anything bad about Pandora, other than the fact that if you don't have internet you can't use it. But, most devices have mobile data and/or a personal hotspot, so if you REALLY feel the need to listen, you can. I love Pandora!"

"7363","Pandora","A great app","Poorkitten","May 19, 2014",4,"This is a great app if you want to discover new bands. It has a radio system for bands and genres. Each station has about five bands that are similar to the main band on that station. It mixes songs from those bands in with the band you know, so you hear songs that you might like. This app helped me discover 5 new bands that I really like. The major problem I seem to have is that even if a band has 6 albums, I constantly plays the same 10-15 songs. This really annoys me because if I look on youtube for songs from said band, I see all these songs I never knew existed and I very well might like better than what i hear on pandora. I know pandora has them in their library because if I look at the album information, I can get 30 second samples of songs. It doesn't seem that hard to just randomly pick any of the 50 songs that a band might have."

The only way to stop is to go into the app settings and forceclose it... But then it might ""Misbehave""  haha..  It's already misbehaving!!  While you are fixing that glitch, you might want to consider a sleep timer. That would be a wonderful addition to your app...adding one extra star, the menu button is now fixed on the Kindle Fire, now we can ""quit"" instead of forceclosing, thank you.A sleep timer will complete the app and make it 5 star!I am not sure about the problems others are having, songs not completing, ads, etc. All my stations play perfectly, always have. as far as ads, I am usually doing something besides staring at the album art so I rarely notice the ads, sometimes there is a break for an audible ad, but no big deal.If the ads bother you, it's easy to fix, just get the paid app.After several hours of using the app it will pause and ask if you are still listening. All you got to say is yes or no... if you aren't it will stay paused. no big deal and I appreciate that."

What I did was to remove it from my device and reload it everytime I wanted to use it.  That was a bit of a hassle, I thought, but yesterday I realized in frustration when it came up with the pandora screen and I just tapped that screen, it opened.  Boy, did I feel silly! In my defense, I am over 50 and what is supposed to be ""intuitive"" to many isn't ""intuitive"" to me.  Anyway, I'm thrilled that I figured that out and am now able to listen to all my channels on the great speakers on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would have rated it with 5 stars except that there are more adds on this free version than on my free nook app."

"7832","Pandora","Who Doesn't Love Free Music?","Eric A. Burr","January 15, 2014",5,"I've been using this app for years. These days, many people seem to be turning to Spotify. But Pandora does not hammer you with so much in the way of intrusive advertising. The algorithm sometimes makes what seem like odd choices of related music and artists, but in the end I'm very impressed with how well it does. If you take the time to actually thumbs-up and tumbs-down tunes you like and don't like (respectively), over time you will build stations that suit your taste exactly. And one of the nicest features is discovering tunes and musicians you love that you probably never would have discovered otherwise. I'm an Android user, and the app works seamlessly on my phone."

"8164","Pandora","Pandora Was My Favorite, Edited Songs, Limited Library, Repeat Songs","B. Good","May 27, 2013",3,"I have used Pandora since around 2006. It seemed at that time (in my experience)Pandora was one of the only services offering free streaming of music based on user input. I have Pandora One and I am disappointed that despite changing my settings to allow explicit content many of the songs are edited. It seems that the same songs are played several times over, even within a few hours. I still use Pandora Radio but I am losing enthusiasm fast. There are now many other similar services that offer a much greater selection of songs. I have tried several of the other services and the music has much more variety on many of the other services._Bottom Line_ I would carefully compare all services before committing to one. There are now so many to choose from and each service has its limitations. Each service also has its perks too. Do some research and find out what fits best. Yes, I still recommend Pandora Radio to friends but I no longer recommend paying for the service. This review is based on my own opinion, individual experience, and style. I do not believe this is a one size fits all."

Now, we each hear what we want to hear and nothing else.At home, we stream Pandora through an iPod using BlueTooth into the stereo that plays throughout the house.  That has saved us from getting bored with our own (extensive, but too familiar) music collection.One of the most fun things we have done with Pandora was to pass the iPod around at a party for friends to start new ""Pandora radio stations"" for us by selecting musicians who were new to us.  Found a world of great music that way.LOVE Pandora."

So if you got 5$ a month to pay for add-free music go ahead. The only bad thing about this service is the limit of it's music. It only has only 1 million songs. (It's true; search it up.) Meaning that after a while of listening to a station for so long you start noticing the same songs coming on. Easy product but it's limited.This is why I use Spotify. Spotify has 20 million songs. So pay 5 dollars for music that you can't really look for specifically or pay 10 dollars a month for no adds unlimited listening and search and play exact songs. Now I just sound like a Spotify employee lmao. Anywho, Spotify is better."

"8928","Pandora","So good I listen for hours","authorncr","December 15, 2013",5,"I'm a late-comer to Pandora. I subscribed about a month ago and have told my friends about it because it's made a big improvement in my life.  That sounds melodramatic but it's true.  I have always been a music lover and studied classical piano seriously when I was young. A few years ago I developed a physical condition that required me to quit working, limit my driving and avoid crowds.  I'm living on a shoestring.  And I live way out in the sticks.  There's no cell reception, cable or public transportation here.  On Pandora I set up six stations to fit my taste in music.  The first day I set up a station combining piano jazz and classical piano.  I listened to it day in and day out until I felt satisfied.  Next I went to blues and folk. Yesterday I listened to my favorite rock + roll for hours and learned about music that is new to me.  That's part of the reason I like Pandora so much -it combines what I know with new choices. Also, the quality of Pandora 's sound is first rate.  I took the upgrade right away - it's an inexpensive way to get rid of ads."

After a few songs it stops playing. It's disappointing to know such a great app can have so many glitches.It's not like I don't like Pandora, because I really do. I like how it's free but of course, free is limited... but to be honest, you can do lots of things users that pay them can. For once. It's great to know that I can listen to certain music instead of a mix.Overall I love it! :)"

Several of my friends have subscribed to other stations that offer what Pandora offers, but at monthly charge rates that can add  up over the course of a years time.I have chosen several programs, on Pandora that meet my listening needs and have added peace and soothing my mind over sometimes stressful  times and also offered me music of many music artists that I grew with when I was younger and are much more soothing than much of what I hear, on the general FM stations today.I look forward to listening more to Pandora in the future. Keep up the good broadcasting services you now are offering.The world today can be a hectic environment and peaceful music is more than appreciated by me and others that also carry many of the portable devices, like a Kindle Hd or I Pads.Thanks for your current music services.Dennis Ryan, Tampa, Fl"

I don't mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I'm using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy,  playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he doesn't really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that, I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made, which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off, but only to help with little ones music. If that wasn't the case, I would have no problem at all with not paying. So don't delay!  Download today!  Enjoy music for your entire family at your fingertips! It's easy to use as well and keeps all your favorites =)"

I'm tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? Won't renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they're focused on a young audience."

For others with already extensive collections, it is redundant at best.Then, there's the randomness.  You start with some single song or artist, or maybe even a vague genre as a base and it randomly tries to figure out what (based on music DNA) you might like related to that baseline.  And trying to teach it some of the most-simple things like ""I hate this artist, in total"", just seem to be beyond the comprehension of the app.Not horrible.  But plenty of room for improvement."

But for me there are three major glitches to work out.1.) It won't let me log back into Pandora without removing from my device and redownloading it.2.) Half the time it won't let me listen to music, it'll say that it can't find anymore related songs to change the station, but it does that on every station and hasn't gotten any better, it's done that to me very time this week I've tried to listen.3.) When the warning first popped up, it said I had 48 hours of free music left, so I logged out wanting to save it for long car rides, but when I logged back in a couple of days later it said I had no free music left, even though I hadn't listened to it at all.So Pandora, I'm willing to give you two stars for excellence in music, but I won't go any higher than that because of the glitches, I'd appreciate it very much if you would fix them, then maybe I can give you five stars."

That said, audio quality is excellent.Not a 4-star product because it nags with emails to the hub!  Would be 5-stars if native for BlackBerry and also not nag to emails.---UPDATE: June 30, 2017- At some point, after an app update, Pandora's audio stream became flaky and unreliable resulting in frequent herky-jerky audio and frequent error messages upon attempt launch ""Pandora not responding"".  Used to be able to use hihj-quality audio stream, but now even with lower quality stream problem is very frequent. Interestingly, all my other live-stream apps function great 99% of the time that I experience problems with Pandora.  So, if it is related to weak cell signal, it certainly is rarely effecting other live-stream audio apps (music and voice).- Pandora used to allow users to increase buffer size to workaround such issues but no longer.- Downgraded to one-starNo guidance from Pandora on this issue and referred to generic Android troubleshooting tips which were useless."

The only bad thing I have found about pandora is that adds are fairly frequent.To remove ads you have to upgrade to pandora one, which has a monthly fee.I  have never had pandora crash on me and no glitches.....Overall great app that I would recommend to anyone.Ps.

I tried to type in Led Zeppelin and my favorite song, Stairway to Heaven, but it shows a lot other music that you don't want to listen to. ·You can type in The Beatles then Jimmy Hendrix could show up. You only get three skips to skip a song you don't like. Total rip off. You can't listen to the music you typed in; only random music of that genre. ·Also, it doesn't even let you make a playlist of your favorite music. You will be lucky if you get a few songs by that artist or the one song you typed in. Sometimes even if you don't get the song you want, you can listen to others that you might like. · Another flaw is that you can't listen to the same song again after you listen to it once. You cannot replay nor can you rewind or fast forwarded songs.Waste of time for those of you who want to listen to certain music.I give this 5/10."

I love all types of music so being able to pick a station that will play classic country today and Hip Hop the next is wonderful.  You can even see the song lyrics while the song is being played.  I just wanted the free version and not have to pay so for this feature you do have to listen to ads.  I don't mind because it is worth it.  Pandora is so great that I went online and ordered two portable speakers so I can really hear my music as loud as I like.  I can hear it on my iphone, Kindle, laptop and now on my computer at work.  It's great to have your favorite music playing in the background while you work.  No radio to have to keep up with and find a empty outlet.

Create a station and listen to similar songs you haven't heard yet. Like a song? Thumb it up and the station will play more like that, dislike one and thumb is down and it won't play it again.It's not as efficient when you selection songs or genres that are unique, but if you like an eclectic selection of music across different genres it works very well."

On my latest phone, I have not had any issues whatsoever.  I love the fact that a person can create their own stations and I feel that Pandora does a good job of choosing music based upon my likes and dislikes.  Pandora is used all the time at my house.  I do have the free version, which has occasional ads.  However, the ads are few enough that it does not bother me.  If ads do annoy a person, then an ad free version of the app can be purchased."

It really does not get much better.We played the Christmas channel while wrapping holiday gifts and it was perfect. They will occasionally plug in a short commercial which is not very intrusive and does not last long or occur too frequently, but for a free service, it is well worth it.It suggests songs for you based on the ones you have already listened to and you can set playlists that allow you to listen to the BGs and the Beatles on the same play list."

"11421","Pandora","Pandora Review","Grace Marino","February 18, 2015",5,"Five star rating for excellence in music. Two things I would recommend though. 1.) Don't put adds on, even if you haven't upgraded to pro yet. This will help us enjoy worshiping the Lord, and having our minds focused on Him. 2. ) I suggest that you have more song selections for an artist, instead of switching to different artists on their radio. For example, if Phil Wickham has more albums out, could his station just play more of those, instead of just one or two? That's my thoughts. Otherwise I would give it a five star rating because of its easy access, availability to access different stations and the  superb bookmarks as well. Thanks for your free service Pandora, I will have to say though that your Christian stations are the best! :)"

I have a smart tv, so I get it right on my tv, and it's nice when I want to clean or not be distracted by tv shows. It caters to my musical needs, gives me songs that I like. So no need to change the stations, just know that the type of music I like will be played. I plan on making more stations, so that I can listen to a variety of music. The only thing I don't like is that if I want to change stations, I have to exit Pandora and start over. Would be nice if it gave you the option to change stations in the menu."

If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I've even been using it on my laptop.Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I've locked in Usher and it's been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. It's super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you don't like (it'll skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.)I recommend this for ANY music lover, you won't regret it & it's free."

It is a very pleasurable thing to have on your phone, and I very much enjoy it. A few downsides would be that unless you upgrade it, you have constant commercials and advertizments  which sometimes block your ability to view the album cover and/ or the song lyrics. Also, you often get a mix of artists on your station, even if you specify a particular artist. So, you may have, for example, a Lady Gaga station but instead of Lady Gaga it constantley plays Ke$ha and Rhiana and Miley Cyrus, which is perfectley fine. It just may take a while to find a Lady Gaga song and it doesnt allow you to press skip very often because you have a dailey skip limit, which virtually most radio apps have, anyway. I enjoy it none the less, and I hope that you will, too!:)"

I love how I can tailor the station to the types of music I like and thumbs down the music and songs I don't like.  There are also very few commercials, unlike with the radio where you can get 5 minutes worth of commercials at a time.  When I get in the car I put on my seat belt, start the car, and set up Pandora through Bluetooth.  It has become part of my driving routine.

"11639","Pandora","How did it know that?","Jacob Huelstrunk","September 20, 2013",4,"It's very easy to get in a musical rut, playing the same album, playlist or group over and over. Pandora combats this. What first seems a shortcoming, limiting the number of songs from a given artist it can play in a time period, is actually it's best feature. Pandora does a good job of selecting other music similar to your original criteria. What's really amazing is, as you give more feedback about what you like and don't like, it does an uncanny job of selecting tunes that appeal to your taste.  I know Pandora advertises this proprietary feature up front but I'm really amazed at how well it works.On the down side, the Windows interface is great, clean and user friendly, but I find the Android version on my phone a challenge. Part of the problem is my big fingers, poor eyesight and penchant for bright sunshine. Still, I think they should take that into account in a mobile app."

But it is really frustrating how often it reopens after just pausing it. I often pause because we like the song and something is making it hard to hear and then there is no way to get back to it. It also happens when it disconnects from a blue tooth device.  It doesn't just go back to playing from the phone it closes."

So I was pretty upset about that cause I really like Pandora but I guess I can still use it on a regular computer. Honestly I think a great app for a kindle fire or any tablet would be Iheartradio because its free,you never have to pay and it's somewhat similar to what Pandora gives you and also you can listen to your favorite radio stations. But overall Pandora is an awesome app it just sucks it's not always going to be free."

When you set this playlist, not all of the songs are by the artist listed. On the Frank Sinatra list, I get Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, and many more. On many days, I will switch between lists, depending on my mood. This app is well worth downloading."

One is able to set up their favorite music, Gospel, 60s, 70s, etc. and choose according to their mood which to listen to.  I am probably preaching to the choir.

"13484","Pandora","it's always running","Robert Hewes","May 18, 2014",2,"I like Pandora.  When I paid for a subscription I listened to my favorite styles of music on my android tablet, my Kindle Fire and my pc.  When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire.  This app keeps telling me I've ""timed out"", even though I haven't listened to it for days.  The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated.  I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used!  Some apps never stop running.  This seems to be one of them.  I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I couldn't get in to do that.  If you want to pay for a subscription, you won't have this problem.  But at least for now I'm through with this app that counts itself as running when it isn't being used."
"13485","Pandora","A+ app","E. S. Moeller","August 27, 2015",5,"This is a great great app! I actually found some people I never even heard of, like Jasmine Thompson, Avril Levigne, and (ikr) Meghan Trainor. They are now some of my favorite singers. The only problem are the ads. They aren't super bad, it's just that they happen at all. It's just a commercial off and on, or ""tap the banner below to go to blah blah blah "".My advice : just don't skip every single song. It makes more commercials! Also, when you skip, you eventually use up all your skips for an hour. Other than that, it's a great app!"

Make sure to turn your receiving device off if you are not listening because Pandora gets charged even though you are not hearing the music.  We made this mistake to begin with our radio playing thru the stereo system.  We just turned off the stereo but the streaming continued for many hours.  Sorry about that Pandora we watch it now."

Initially it wasn't too bad, but the more Pandora was played, the more commercials were played. Also, many of the the pop up ads have an adult theme to them, so beware of the commercial/ad content. I'm sure their idea is to breakdown the user by having so many commercials that they'll download the app with the monthly fee. Boo! :("

I would prefer having an option to listen to ONLY a particular person or group.  Being ""introduced"" to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to.  The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music.  Overall, I'm pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days.  I plan to continue my subscription indefinitely ~~ unless they change something drastically in a way that doesn't work for me.  So far, It's a perfect solution for me."

While it works fine on the Android tablets, Pandora is a nightmare on the Kindle Fire.  It takes forever to load (and usually multiple tries); it often stops playing for no apparent reason in the middle of songs, and may or may not resume at any given moment; and even if it does play well, when I try to turn Pandora off it won't shut off.  I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit.Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire.

I use Pandora as a way to find other similar artists - this works especially well in classical music. I don't mind the ads - a lot of times I get value from those, too, because the ads are for local deals and specials.

I have one called ""Loretta Lynn Radio"" She is classic country music .. I have female singers from that era on there...

I only received my Kindle about 2 weeks ago and am already getting lots of repeat songs, which shouldn't be happening so soon with all the zillions of songs out there.  Also, when I click on the Beatles station, I get a lot of music before Beatles music happens.  Yes, I'm on shuffle, but I thought when I was on a station, I'd hear at least a lot of that music.  But the short loop is my primary dissatisfaction.  I haven't updated to the no-advertisement membership because I don't mind them.  I thought perhaps if I did upgrade, I'd get a longer time between repeat songs, but that's not what no-ads means, so I'm not sure that would solve the problem."

In my case I created several 'radio stations' based on performers such as  Simon & Garfunkel.  I know S & G have recorded many songs but only heard three or four of them along with a lot of other performers music that was of only marginal interest to me.  If you skip too many songs - you get a message that is not allowed as often as you like.I also found over the two months I tried using it that most of the music was from albums recorded at  'live' events, I prefer the higher quality studio songs - I don't seem to have any choice in the issue.

No airplane mode with this one! It took me a little time to figure out how to navigate, but it's fairly simple, so I think I've got the basics down. The best part is that you can run this in the background while you do other things on your Kindle; I like to listen as I read, especially since I haven't gotten my own music onto my Fire yet.

When you enter an artist, you get a mix of that artist along with similar artists.  You can put in multiple artists and put the music on shuffle and it will go back and forth between artists/genres.  Although not significant, I have found that the information/lyrics are sometimes incorrect.  For example, I can't remember who they said wrote the song OHIO, but it was not the correct artist-it was written by Neil Young.  Not generally a big deal or problem.  I have opted to not pay the 3.99/mo to get Pandora commercial free as they are all less than 30 seconds and for me are not bothersome."

Perfect,  now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car,  leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and  blare music.  When I'm  in a meeting or library.  Awesome.... Fix your app,  Pandora.  There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance.  I know that I would never pay for premium  these issues."
"14421","Pandora","what was the point???","Moniquevt","May 16, 2016",4,"I love the app but one problem: the comment section.  People keep leaving chain mail for example, say this kiss your hand  post this on other songs in minutes and you will have good luck and people are swearing and giving out personal information.  And I keep saying, "" do not give out personal information like that you never know what will happen."". And people are just being inappropriate.  So, either take down the comment section or make sure to be super strict like on Moviestar Planet."

What a treat.  No more crap radio."

But the big deal is adds. Every song I play, I leave my fire on my bed and listen to an add, and another one comes on. UUUUURRRRRGGGGG!!!!! So I almost put a 4 star rating.😞😠. But my 💜 (heart) told me not to. So I didn't. I told my mom last night I wish that there were NO adds in the world. But I have really great station's like Dove Camron or Ariana Grande."
"14429","Pandora","Same Songs","Amazon Customer","November 14, 2016",3,"I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I sometimes hear the same songs over and over again - in the same order. It's getting a little aggravating, because even though I like those songs, I don't want to hear the same ones in the same order every time I listen to a station. I've only noticed it happening on the Pop Rock radio I have, thankfully. Pandora often offers me a new song when I first click on the station, but it's usually a song I don't like (and I'm not holding that against them, of course). So I'll put a thumbs down. But then I get the same songs all over again. It's quite frustrating."
"14430","Pandora","No Remedy","Glenn S Sales","September 3, 2015",1,"Worked great for 4 months, but now will not play at all!  This is the second phone (HTC ONE M9) that this has happened to. The other phone was a Galaxy S4, the situation could never be resolved on that phone either. I have been a paying subscriber for a long time now, but that ends today. Too many people have the same problem as I do and Pandora's solution does not work. I hate to say goodbye to Pandora but I don't feel that I have any choice. Thank you."

"14434","Pandora","Good music app","Alani Scott","October 4, 2016",4,"Good music app. You are able to create a profile and start listening right away without having to download each song. You are able to pick an artist or genre and it gives you a variety of music. You can pick anything from smooth jazz to lil wayne. There a few short ads that pop up in between songs. You are able to skip I think 5 or 6 at a time if you don't want to hear it at the moment. This app learns your tastes and will suggest songs or remove ones you didn't like from your playlist. I like that you can even listen to comedy skits or holiday music. If you are looking for a good music app this is it."

"14437","Pandora","I loved how there was a programming bug at one point ...","S. PARKINSON","August 2, 2015",3,"Pandora app works as intended, however having a video add literally every 2-3 songs is a bit excessive. I loved how there was a programming bug at one point of time that caused AD interruptions, however seems like that has been since fixed. The only other thing I can think of is how it recommends like artists for your playlist. Very redundant on songs, little variety. Some recommendations are complete outside the genre that you are listening to. Songs that I have downvoted still play, it is a very broken system. If Grooveshark wouldn't have been shut down, I would definitely not be using Pandora. Needs improvement for sure."
"14438","Pandora","Excited, and then...","Jose Guillermo Luque Sanchez","May 8, 2014",1,"I was reading the reviews while Pandora got downloaded on my kindle, then I open it, and...  It didn't work on Peru. Yes, I am in Peru and I talk English pretty well, and I am American. Yeah, confusing. But the point is that it doesn't work everywhere. It just works in the US.Bam, they got me. I usually give good reviews, but I couldn't even use it, so, what's the point?Thanks, and put useful to this review, please.Oh, I think you'd like hotspot fm. Look for I, it's free.Thanks"
"14439","Pandora","I Love this App","Hollie W.","October 29, 2016",5,"Love this app. I can listen to all my favorite artists and it selects music according to what I have listened to. Only downside is you can only skip 5 songs at a time and then you have to listen to what they have chosed."

"14441","Pandora","pure amazing!","HayHay Hamrick 2000","June 3, 2013",5,"This app is awesome. So can make your own playlists by your favorite singers or songs. And most of the songs allow you to look at the lyrics for that song. Another reason why this app is awesome is because you can listen to songs for hours and they never pay the same songs over and over again. You can also taste the songs if they are playing a song that u dont like then u can hit the thumb down button and it will never pay that song on that playlist again. This app is great. I highly recommend this app. The only bad thing is you only get six skips per hour on each playlist. But when your listening to Pandora time flies by!"

I have created a lot of radio stations, but when I made a station from one particularly relaxing track (by David and Steve Gordon), Pandora found more music like it than I ever expected to find. I love discovering new titles and learning about the artists. This station is like being at a spa every time I hear the selection of music that Pandora plays. I hope Pandora will always be around."

"14448","Pandora","Could always be better","Andrea Lindauer","January 23, 2014",4,"I would give it 5 stars, if, when searching for a song, or creating a station based on a song, that song is played first, so I know I've chosed the right song/artist. Another reason for the less than perfect rating is the commericals. I understand the need for them, but not more than once every 3 songs. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue is buffering. Mine does that a lot, right in the middle of the song sometimes."
"14449","Pandora","Pandora is the best music program we have ever experienced.","ezboomer","May 9, 2014",5,"My wife and I chose this app. after we purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The variety of music with Pandora isthe best we have ever heard. Many of the album cuts by the artists you choose and others are cuts wehave never heard and it's always a pleasure to hear a song by a favorite artist for the first time.Their may be other apps out there that are similar to Pandora and maybe better but my wife and I aren't looking.We are permanent Pandora listeners. It also works well with our TV's through Roku and Smart TV's.We highly recommend Pandora for all music lovers and the variety it brings to your life."

I have been able to check my favorites list when I wanted to check out a song I've heard for the first time I liked.

If there's one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100% of the time, it's an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes, maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times (maybe alarm related?). Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service, and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."

A lot of different channels, but I tend to have a core set of about 8-9 that I listen to all the time.  Also appreciate that Pandora can be set up to play when my Kindle is in sleep mode --  helps save on the battery.

After a few months of teaching Pandora my likes versus dislikes, she truly has learned my tastes. When I change from my personal stations, I know exactly what I am going to get. I even enjoy mixing things up a bit when I dabble with the premade channels Pandora makes available.  They are very good but my personal preference are the stations I create by choosing my favorite songs and genres.  Great job Pandora."

And you can get spotify Premium but its like 10/20 dollars every Month witch is not that bad...But dont worry spotify is already good!And on spotify you can change the quality in your settings.Oh yeah i forgot to tell you on spotify right after your trial runs out you might need to reset your profile because it well start to not let you listen to your music (Maybe) and i hate that ad on pandora about Jim Carlyles.com its so annoying,But anyways i don't recommend this App unless you want to hear an ad after every song!"

I have purchased music from bands I would have never listened to, and 99pct of whose music I find awful. But Pandora can find that one song that said band stuck on sone album five years ago, and see based on the songs Musical Genome that I might enjoy it. And I almost always do!Pandora and its Music Genome Project are light years beyond any other music streaming sites algorithms based on genres, playlists or whatever. The music industry owes Pandora big time for keeping people like me buying music I never would have known was just my taste."

This app easily plays in the background while reading an e-book or surfing the web.

"14527","Pandora","Pandora NO TuneIn YES","Sandy","December 31, 2011",3,"A friend recommended this app as a must have for my new fire, so i figured I would give it a try.  It's a nice enough app but wasn't what I was looking for at all. If you are looking for a BASIC music selection then this might work for you, if you have more eclectic tastes then I would suggest TuneIn (another free app)Why?First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off.Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you.TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSICJust sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 ""genres"" and TuneIn 25 -I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right?  That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is.  Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this ""genre"".1 of Pandora's 23 genres is ""World"" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, CajunYUP 13 channels. Let's start by looking for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with ""worldbeat"" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on ""worldbeat"" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right?  WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world.  Nice I guess, but not what I was looking for.In comparison click TuneIn's ""World"" genre and  - well look at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought!TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking ""Japanese"".  Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied!  But wait?  What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - ""Results 1 - 25 of about 257""  Wait??  You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are looking for.Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either)A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback.  TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.)TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.)So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN."

For 2, maybe 3, songs after you hit ""like"" it will play similar sounding songs, but it has gone far off track far more times than I would like.Pandora also does not carry nearly as many unheard of bands as another app that I frequently use."

It is Pandora 'radio,' not Pandora 'you pick it, you play it.' If you don't like the chosen song, you must still listen to it.It may not be just what I wanted, but I still give it credit. It is an awesome radio station and it is introducing me to a lot of new music based on the bands I do listen to which is far better than listening to the average airwave radio station.Based on ease of use and the fact that it was free, you can't hardly go wrong with this one. :P"

It played one piece of Mozart music (from Eine Kliene Nacht Music. Really??? Can't you do better than that?))  Then it played some Beethoven.  Then it played an ad.  Two pieces of music, and then an ad.  I naively had visions of intelligent listening of classical music, but all I got were 2 pieces classical ""Pop"" music and then an ad.  I immediately removed it from my Kindle."
"14591","Pandora","No, just no","Nikki","February 20, 2015",1,"Too many ads, you have to pay to get rid of them. They put albums in your radio station even though I only want 1 song.

"14592","Pandora","Don't get this app.","Peter L.","April 6, 2014",1,"I deleted it after I downloaded it onto my phone.

It is next to impossible to find the artists I love.  Antonio Maggie, Emmanuel Moire, Tiziano Ferro, Sinsemilia,  Paolo Meneguzzi, Povia. The app assumes I do not mean what I type in the search bar.  It is useless to me.  I emailed Pandora support, I heard nothing back. I will find another app that doesn't presume & actually reads my search criteria."

It kept spooling, and then, after it had me set up my user name and password, twice, it told me that there was an error and to contact their support.  After 5 minutes of waiting, I hung up and uninstalled the program from my phone.  My kids love it; but my experience was awful.  iHeart Radios was smooth and easy to download and I've never had a problem with it......guess I'll use that from now on."

I absolutely love it and the selection of channels and variety of music they have available. I am giving this a four star rating because I do wish new music would become available a little bit more often other than every few weeks on the stations you select to listen to. If you are looking for a good music station, I highly recommend Pandora. My absolute favorite internet radio station of all time !"

All I listen to is Pandora now but I come across the same songs all the time. It seems as though they play only the popular songs or have no k n owing of any different miles  you have been listening for hours. I sometimes Mark the thumbs down on some songs and somehow they still play in time . I just wish they could come up with more updated songs and add more than what they've been playing."

This is a radio program you dont need to know where I am. It wold be ok but even with locations off you keep pestering for it to be on. No means no. Pandora permissions keep getting more invasive. Creepy. If it isn't fixed will swap to new app.If you have older versions dont updated."
"14607","Pandora","Best music product!","amanda","January 30, 2013",5,"Pandora is a creative and entertaining way to receive music from your favourite artists. You type In an artist and Pandora will play songs and artists that are similar to the artists genre. While you listen to music you may go online or play games at the same time. Pandora  allows you to skip a limited amount of tracks. You can only skip about 5 songs on that station. Although you may skip about five more tracks again after an hour. There is also ads between songs, but probably after every 5 or more songs. You can pay with an ad-free experience with Pandora for around $6.00. Another thing I like about Pandora is that if you see a song you like it will ask you if you want to buy it on iTunes or bookmark it. On Pandora you cannot replay a track or rewind it. I enjoy my experience with pandora and I think it is worth buying."
"14608","Pandora","Advertisements everywhere","Jessie","June 22, 2015",1,"This app is full of advertisements, even more than the website has. I was okay with the ads between songs but now the app plays video ads between songs too. There's also a ad in left hand corner so whenever I like or dislike a song I am hit with another ad. All the ads I get between every song has ruined this app for me."

Are. True. It's very frustrating that it works on a computer but not on my kindle. When you click on the app, it just shows the beginning screen and doesn't change. I hope they fix the bugs!

It doesn't always shut down internally even though I use the QUIT feature.  Then it will launch ok.

No loud annoying commercials anymore like on the radio. Hate the radio now and refuse to listen to it anymore since I've been listening to Pandora. I'm thoroughly spoiled and will never go back!

I can never find anything good on the radio so I always turn to my Pandora App for my number one source of music.  It's super easy to use.  Just type in a band, artist, or song you like and Pandora will suggest different songs and Artists that sound similar to what you have chosen.  You can thumbs up or thumbs down songs that you don't like and Pandora won't play those any longer.  The more you rate and customize your stations the more Pandora will play only songs that you like.  It's perfect for me for when I'm listening to music in my car, at the gym, or just about anytime I want to hear music.  I have to say that this has got to be one of my favorite apps ever."

I normally listen everyday while I get ready for work. I'm so sick of some songs and artists by the end of the week I have to delete them from the station: Katy Perry, Lady GaGa, Journey, Hootie and The Blowfish, Goo Goo Dolls and LL Cool J are this weeks victims. Everytime I click any station it's the same five songs that start it. Every. Single. Time. This is great when Iove a new tund. It's torture otherwise. The whole app is more often than not, a waste to me. Sure, I like that song but I dont want to hear it every single day in almost the exact order. I'll just listen to the radio if I want the same stuff over and over. I have about 10 stations I made, 5-10 others made and there is no difference between how often it overplays each song. I've tried the shuffle feature and somehow end up with Christmas music every 3rd song. There used to be an ""add variety"" feature but I've had no luck finding it on my Kindle. The app, for me, is only good for very limited use. Likewise, I don't always have limitless hours to thumbs up or down so on some stations that has made the listening experience almost painful. I used to appreciate the Genome aspect for finding songs I would enjoy. Now it's just a hassle."

It also stops playing music and asks if you want to upgrade to a fee version - you have to answer and then tell it to go back to playing the music.  If you want some background music while working around the house this isn't a very good option.  I went back to playing Pandora on my Blue-ray player because it doesn't have as many interruptions."

No longer and never again will I pay for this terrible service. Also it plays the same songs OVER and OVER. I can't even reccomend the free app because it is so full of advertisements. Amazon music, spotify, Sony music unlimited, and Google's music service are all much better. Amazon music is probably the best."

I am sorry, but I'm never going to buy a Jeep or Lexus. I have switched to Jango and grooveshark. And deleted it off my devices. Also it is always on, you have to force close Pandora as well to completely turn off."

"14669","Pandora","When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer ...","Leo E. Niles","March 2, 2015",1,"When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of 3.99 per month.  All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they didn't get paid. Instead of contacting me, they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up.  I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora.  Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more. I don't mind paying, but really, when you pick a music theme or performer, it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient."
"14670","Pandora","I love this app","courtney","February 20, 2016",5,"I love this app. It is great. It has all the music you want to listen to. You can set your own listening preferences. You can skip a song if you don't like it and it won't be played on your track anymore after that.

If you never tried Pandora before I definitely suggest you give it a try."

However eight times out of ten, the app &#34;is having technical difficulties&#34; or won't recognize the correct log in information.

Pandora allows you to listen to music for free, with commercials. I wish that i could choose what song i wanted to listen to but that is OK.  You are allowed so many song skips per hour of listening.  I love that there are multiple stations that i can choose from.  If you want to you can upgrade to Pandora monthly service for just 4.99 which isn't a bad price if you listen to it a lot and don't want the commercials and you want more skips. all in all this is a great app for music lovers"

I have never been happier with any other music source.  As long as you have internet, this is the way to go 100% of the time.  I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire,  It is the best thing that ever happened to Music.  Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down.  If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like.  It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved.  The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using.  It is just too great for words."

I can choose who and what I like and Pandora will add the same type of music to my choices; if I like it I can keep it, and if not I can just give it a thumbs down and I won't have to hear it anymore.

I'm able to bring up the music I want quickly and easily. I really like the quality of the sound of the music, a lot of the time my Kindle is too soft . I have to use earbuds or a plug in speaker to hear U Tube and some other music I've downloaded. Pandora plays nice and loud .enough through the Kindle. I do hate having to use a password to sign in, it's on MY Kindle which is open I don't see the need of a password."

"14770","Pandora","Get's the job done, but there are better options","Amazon Customer","March 21, 2017",3,"The app itself is ok, but Pandora is getting a little long in the tooth. The constant commercials, the extremely lacking selection, and constant repeats are getting annoying. Back in the day I used Pandora to find new bands, but lately they've been getting stagnant (and redundant). It seems they're going for ""hits"" instead of music that doesn't get played on the Top40. I've moved on to Spotify for the most part, but once in a while will come back to see if they've added anything I like. However, even after a few hours it's still the same songs (not just bands) that played the last time I listened to it. There's hardly any variety with songs and/or bands anymore.Maybe this is a side effect of using the free (or mobile) version; or maybe they just have a very limited selection for specific bands, but it doesn't compel me to buy into it; there's plenty of other options."
"14771","Pandora","Too many commercials","Amazon Customer","December 17, 2012",4,"Yes, I know, that's how they pay for things. But come on, commercials every third song or so? Wow. I remember using Pandora years ago on my computer - it wasn't that bad."

I woke up and discovered the screensaver on and burning up the battery, but no music until I entered my password. Maybe there is a workaround? Hopefully would not require yet another Android permission. How much personal data do you guys need to collect? I'm sure ad revenue and paid versions generate considerable profit. We know the musicians are not being compensated appropriately. As far as the app's overall consistency I will say that things run smooth and it is enjoyable to hear mainstream &#34;radio&#34; hits from time to time. One thing I liked about the old Yahoo Music Jukebox (an earlier platform of audio streaming Pandora seems to have modeled itself on) was having the opportunity to hear much deeper tracks from artists I never knew about."

It works somewhat less well in my Volvo car in that there is a long delay before the first track plays and a rather lengthy delay between each subsequent track. Also, often, Pandora in the Volvo will repeat tracks which is very annoying. But, I love being able to access my favorite styles of music for free and stream them for hours on end. I also like how I am able to listen to different takes by artists than those that are generally played on the radio. And, there are a number of live tracks that are played. It's all good stuff!"

If this app would regularly update I would not even be writing this review. The old version of this software (the version that is being used on Amazon) is not a perfect answer for your music, but it is as good as it gets. Amazon charges a seller fee for every sale and I believe that is the reason that Pandora does not give regular updates on kindle; they can get such a greater profit on iTunes and Google store. It is not Pandora that is doing a bad job; it is Amazon that is not allowing its customers to get regular! updates just for the small effects amount of money they get from it. Come on Amazon"

You want SPOTIFY!","Mariem Scott","January 31, 2016",1,"Like many people, when I first heard of the concept of ""free music"" I rushed to download this Pandora app.  And for a while, it met all my needs.  However, there is a better player in town now and his name is Spotify Music.  If you just want random background noise (random music) that you have little control over, then sure...Pandora will suffice.  But if you want to actually pick the song (and not just the genre!) of what you are going to listen to...then you want Spotify Music .If you still aren't convinced though, a few more facts to help you make your decision:PANDORA1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $4.99/month.3. Library size - 1 million+ songs.4. Can user pick song? NO.5. Can user skip songs? Yes.  But with limitations.  6 skips per hour, per station. No more than 30 skips in 24 hours.SPOTIFY1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $1 for 3 month trial.  Individual membership $9.99/month and each added family member gets 50% discount.3. Library size - 30 million songs!4. Can user pick song? YES!.5. Can user skip songs? YES!  NO LIMITS! :)"

So far there've only been decent ads (regular TV spots) and I think that this is one of the electronic products that you can ""opt out"" of the ad after so many seconds into the ad.  Some of the ads are good (that is, interesting, at least to me).Great product.  I can't recommend it highly enough."

I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can't.  I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I'm used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS DON'T PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that.

However without a doubt it has become my go to app for music. To be able to build music lists from categories, names, styles, genres, or even song titles is just plain awesome. Even though you can't pick the songs that are played on your list you can help it evolve by giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings. I realize that since Pandora has come out there is newer and more sophisticated music apps coming out but so far I keep coming back to Pandora. Personally I subscribe to Pandora One which has been $36 per year and allows you to listen to music non-stop without commercial interruption. Highly recommended."

The service has been almost flawless, a month ago I did an upgrade of the app on my iphone 4s and Pandora started crashing (buffering errors and freezing). It took 2 weeks for a newer version to be available for download, after downloading the newer version the program stopped crashing (buffering errors and freezing). The one other thing that bothers me is that Pandora will not let you skip as many songs as you want, even though you are a paid subscriber. I understand they have to pay for every song played or skipped, but I'm paying them to be able to skip at my leisure and they wont allow it. The stations I create are always compiled great and the thumb print radio feature plays all my likes, which is really cool. There are other music streaming apps out there but to me Pandora is the most well rounded as far as having the most songs and artist I like. I use Pandora on my computer and all my devices, as for now I am going to keep using Pandora until something better is available."

Sound quality is fixed, but the song name still doesn't change when the song does.Original Review: Audio quality sounds terrible compared to my 2012 KFHD7, I use High Quality in both devices. App does not display the new song title when the song changes. Videos on mobile YouTube sound 10x better than this version of the Pandora App. App needs to be fixed, as it is not playing high quality audio and is not updating the name of the song."

If I listen to a customized playlist of songs I own, I will eventually get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. With a station on Pandora, however, I get songs that I familiar with and new songs, in a random order each time. If I don't like a song, I simply hit ""thumbs down"". If I like a song, I hit ""thumbs up"" and it plays more frequently than other songs on that station. Over time, the station becomes so customized that I am listening to lots of songs I like plus new songs I've never heard before. It's nice to shake things up sometimes."

It wasn't showing up in my BlackBerry World list of installed apps, though there was an icon on the home screen.  So, I went to the Amazon App Store, from which I had installed the app, and acted like I wanted to install it again.  It told me that I already had installed the app...and then the app opened.  I logged in and listened to a few minutes of music, then closed the app.  I expected not to be able to re-launch the app, but lo and behold, it launched fine.  I then went to BlackBerry World to recheck the list of installed apps and Pandora still wasn't listed, perhaps because it was installed via the Amazon App Store.  Regardless, I'm upping my stars from two to four.I am a daily Pandora user on Android devices, smart TVs, etc., and want to be able to use it on my BlackBerry Classic.  It installed, but will not launch.  If anyone has tips on how to get Pandora to work on a BlackBerry Classic running OS 10.3.2.556, I'm all ears!"

I have been using Pandora for well over 10 years and I think it is the best.  You can listen for free and get the occasional ad or pay a very fair monthly price and get ad free music with a lot of neat extras. I miss the days of AM radio with unbiased DJs and good music - the kind of music we listened to when cruising the boulevards back in the early sixties......Pandora brings that time back.  Works well with bluetooth."

"15470","Pandora","great!","M. Moose","May 19, 2012",5,"this is a good app. it is free, it has a lot of songs, and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres, too.  this app only has a few downsides, it can only skip 6 times per hour per station, and when you thumbs down a song, a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying.  some people want this app to upgrade, which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people don't know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs, genres, and handles skipping and ""artists that you don't like"" very well. this costs $40 a year, but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email, so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices, you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora.  I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean, espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time."

This online music service allows you create custom radio stations based on genres of music, artists, and even specific songs. As you listen, Pandora lets you rate songs by giving a thumbs up or down, or skip tracks altogether. This helps it figure out your likes and dislikes to create a playlist perfectly unique to you.  It's important to be an active listener for the algorithm to do its job. Recently, the app added a great new feature, alarm clock. Now you can wake up to your favorite Pandora stations instead of the same old buzzing sounds of your usual alarm clock. I find this app especially helpful when I exercise.  I like to listen to upbeat music during a workout but get so tired of preset playlists.  This is an app I use daily."

The only thing I wasn't sure about was how to quit Pandora at first.  There is a Quit option, but you must be on the main screen (the one that displays your stations) to utilize it.  My Kill app wasn't even able to shut it down.  I try to conserve battery life as much as possible.  Once I found that Quit option I was much happier with the app."

But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons.  Plus for this downgrade in features and functions, they started charging more money per month.  Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call, talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere, whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel - NO REFUNDS - you just have to wait till your subscription runs out.  So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers.  Maybe it's ok for your cell phone, but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there - I've switched to Amazon Music."

Don't act like you've never done it lol ! I do wish that you could skip as many songs as you wanted to on the free version tho and of course it goes without saying, I wish it were completely free but I'm not complaining because it's a great app!"

I used to be able to create a station, and if I encountered a song or artist elsewhere that I enjoyed I could add them to the station later using the Add Variety feature. At least I could do it on my desktop app. However, that feature has apparently been removed. So now, once I create a station it's seeds are locked and I am stuck with the option of only liking/disliking the music that the station provides.There is still a Pandora Help page on how to Add Variety, but it's instructions don't work. I will stay with Pandora only because I have so much invested in the stations that I have created. But unless and until they include Add Variety again, I would NOT recommend this to a new user. I only hope that they include it again soon."

I have been using this App for years, since my first iPhone 3G. This has been by far my favorite music app.+ Free! Who doesn't like free?!+ High quality sound. Even with a weak signal, Pandora plays like these songs are stored in my phone.+ A wide variety of stations to choose from. Rock, country, hip hop, R&B, jazz, classical, electronic, disney, and even music from movies! Also by year, the 70s, 80s, 90s, latest hits, Pandora has it all.+ Create your own group of music. If you only favor a few bands, even from different genre, you can combine them in a group so it will only play the type that you enjoy listening.+ Thumb up and down system. If there is a song you like, thumb it up and it will play more often or more of the same artist. Thumb down and it will never be played again.+ Alarm clock! With the latest update Pandora offers your favorite station as your alarm clock. This will ensure to get you moving and not hit that snooze button!+ No commercial or interruption! This could just be me, I use the same account for my mobile device and my pc. When I listen on my pc there is zero commercial. On my phone however there is ads once in awhile. Not sure what triggers it. But the ads are always short and happens every few songs.Give it a try and you won't regret it. I have been using this for years and even after trying others, I prefer Pandora."

Because they went from allowing two devices to stream at one time to just one device at a time. No notice. No email or anything explaining the change. Just BAM! Sorry, you can't do that anymore. When I contacted them they didn't seem to overly care that they made this change without any notice. They were willing to log me out of any and all devices and force me to change my password but to be able to stream on two devices at the same time meant paying for another account (at a higher rate). I would now have TWO accounts. One paying the same I'd paid for the last four years: $3.99 and the new account paying MORE at $4.99. No thanks."

"15521","Pandora","Free Music!","R. Toro","April 25, 2012",5,"If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour (although it is not unlimited).However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for $0.99.  That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on (for example, only on weekdays). It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a ""sleep timer"" that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval (currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes) so that the app doesn't play music all night while you sleep."

I like the selection of music they play for me in the four or five genres I play the most. There are a few advertisements per hour in the free version and that's tolerable.I gave them only three stars because the new user interface is absolutely horrible. Pandora must have been compelled to make things move and make information disappear from view until you direct the cursor over the pictures to make the information visible again. Why? The old interface was simple, clear and functional. Some inexperienced kid out of college must have needed a job and Pandora hired the kid to make the GUI as hard to use as possible.

To be honest I've only downloaded the app because I don't want to drag my Echo into the steamy bathroom. I use the Pandora app to pair my tablet with a waterproof speaker I listen to in the shower. I've created all my stations already with the Echo so although it works just fine all I really do with the app is scroll until I find what I want to listen to for that shower, start it playing and then walk away. It does what I need it to do and the music it picks no matter what 'station' I'm listening to is truly top notch.In a nutshell, I really don't do a lot with the app but it does what I need quite well."

"15541","Pandora","Best music app by far","Amy Showalter","March 30, 2016",5,"Best music app by far. Easy to create channels for all types of music genres and navigation back and forth between them. I eventually purchased the upgrade so that I didn't have to deal with listening to ads between songs. I highly recommend taking that route if you plan on using this as your primary source for listening to music."
"15542","Pandora","Great App!","By   Jbird","July 7, 2016",4,"I love Pandora! Great Channels, great music, everything! But, some songs are super laggy and other times the apps closes on me and stops playing music. Is there were no problems, I would rate this app five star."
"15543","Pandora","I love it and use it daily on every device I ...","Steve Kamerick","November 8, 2017",5,"Don't know why this is here on Amazon, unless they are trying to compare Amazon Prime music with Pandora. OK, I have been a member/customer of Pandora for 9 years, and once quit using because of too many ads, when they quit the distasteful number of ads on free I went back and next decided to go to Pandora-One and recently went even further to Pandora ultimate with no ads at all. I love it and use it daily on every device I own.  I have no complaints. The music is clear and good EQ, perfect for headphones, all Bluetooth speakers and love the stories of the lives of artists."
"15544","Pandora","Pandora - I'll Pass","Ricochet","September 29, 2016",2,"Pandora is my first streaming music experience.  The more I use it, the more I dislike it.  Its song library is extremely limited compared to other providers.  There is very little variety and you hear the same songs over and over if you pick two stations with similar genres.  Buy Pandora One and you still CANNOT skip an unlimited number of songs.  This is total crap. Whats premium if you can control the content.  Don't subscribe and you have to listen to lame ads where people repeat their phone number over and over and over.  Keeping the app as a back up, but moving on to something with a larger library, less repetition and more robust features."
"15545","Pandora","Kindle Edition Is Not Working Out For Me","Duwayne Cole","October 19, 2015",3,"The Kindle Edition of Pandora is good when it works, but that isn't often. The app closes on me frequently, especially when I have a good rotation of songs going. I do not use it on my Kindle Fire as often as I would like because of this. I've updated my device and the app itself and have seen absolutely no improvement on performance. Hopefully, this issue can be resolved in the near future, because I use my Kindle Fire quite often and I would love not to have to juggle two devices just to listen so music."
"15546","Pandora","great for listening to all types of music","suzyq","November 24, 2012",5,"this is a great music app. It allows you to customise the stations you wish to listen to artist. It is nice to listen to music without interruptions."
"15547","Pandora","Is it worth it","Joey","March 6, 2016",4,"I'll be honest Pandora is good at what it does. But it has gone down in quality with all the adds seeing as how every two or so songs I have to deal with 4 adds each time so yeah it's a good app but do you think it's worth paying or waiting through the adds."
"15548","Pandora","One of the best music apps!","LSAnderson40","August 8, 2017",5,"We have been big fans of Pandora since it was released. We love picking an artist and letting the algorithm make really good selections based on that initial artist selection. Also, the application is portable across devices making it ideal for listening anytime. Couple this app with a bluetooth speaker and voila you have your tunes for any occasion."
"15549","Pandora","Amazing!!!!","Vixen","April 3, 2016",5,"I LOVE THIS APP!!! It is amazing. You can make any station you want. Now that they have Thumbprint radio it is 10x better. Thumbprint radio is a station that only plays the songs that you have liked. It's amazing! I very much recommend this app!"
"15550","Pandora","Pandora is my Magic Box","Karen L.","June 23, 2013",5,"Music is my passion. I love many genres.  However, it was difficult to know how to access new music.  By creating my personal stations on Pandora, I have been introduced to many new artists that are now part of my musical world.  I listen to Pandora every day, and am constantly surprised by new and beautiful songs and instrumentals.  I then have new materials for creating my own Playlists, when I purchase music.  Pandora is truly my Magic Box. What a gift!  I subscribe by the month at minimal cost and it's worth every penny!"

"15553","Pandora","Replacing Radio","Karen Fischer","September 8, 2013",5,"I was introduced to Pandora when I bought my Roku about 2-3 years ago.  I am so tired of traditional radio, hearing the same old stuff from 40 years ago, even current music, they play to death.  With Pandora, even if you chose a musical group from 40 years ago, you can hear all of their tracks, not just the ones they play on traditional radio.  You also will hear musical groups from the same Genre.  You can chose any group you like.  Pandora offers an upgrade without commercials, even if you get free Pandora, the commercials/ads are not that long, and you are back to hearing your favorite music.  I recommend Pandora to everyone!"

"15557","Pandora","Listen to the music you want to hear.","George G Shelton","February 5, 2017",5,"I use Echo to access Pandora.  I have asked it to play several different genres of music and it always responds with a nice variety of songs and different artists.  When I ask for a particular artist it plays only songs by that artist.  My only complaint is that the volume control don't control the volume of commercials at the same level as the music.. The commercials are always louder."
"15558","Pandora","Favorite","Kellytjtay","June 1, 2016",5,"I love the variety of music that you can get with Pandora, and I especially love the fact that you can set the station to whoever your favorite artist is.

"15559","Pandora","Pandora music your way, you choice!","Evelynnec","August 8, 2015",5,"I truly enjoy this app for music.  I choose what I want to hear, and when I want to hear it.  I have the capability to set music stations that I like the way I like.  I have stations to get me going, stations for background, and for falling to sleep.  The commercials are not a deterrent for me, there are less than the radio.  Which by the way I never listen to now, Pandora all the time."

Anyways my friend brought up Pandora the other day so I thought I'd see what Pandora has been up to. What happened to them? Since I left Pandora I've gotten a promotion gotten a raise I've even got a new car and my home is even smarter now while Pandora has only updated the page look that's it a new shinny page."

I can see the name of the songs and who is singing them complete unlike listening to the radio.  No call letters of the radio station being blared at me every minute...just music.  You can select whatever stations that you like and give a thumbs up rating to the songs you love to keep them playing when you want to hear them in the future."
"15565","Pandora","Free Pandora App for Kindle Fire","C. Hyde","December 26, 2012",5,"I love love love Pandora & have used it for a few years now!! You can't get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now & not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?"
"15566","Pandora","Discovered through my husband around 2011/2012","Stella Carrier","December 12, 2014",5,"I admit that I cannot remember the exact timeframe that I discovered Pandora, but I believe that it was sometime around summer or autumn 2011 when my husband played music from the app during one of our quiet moments together.  I enjoy that there is a wide range of stations and music genres that one can listen to. I’m open-minded when it comes to willingness to listen to various types of music. Right now, the top three music stations that I am listening to on Pandora the most are chillout, electronica, and indie dance, although I have to humbly credit recently finding out about indie dance from a public relations specialist named heather whaling of geben communication- who listed indie dance being one of their fave stations online. Sometimes I go ahead and also shuffle the over 20 plus radio stations that are set in my Pandora profile in order to listen to satisfy  my eclectic tastes in music. Many of my online music purchases have been influenced by many of the songs and artists I heard on Pandora."
"15567","Pandora","NOT BAD AT ALL","Bill McLean","September 23, 2013",4,"Pandora is very easy to use and users have access to a fantastic selection of stations, music, etc.  And it can be used even when local radio stations close down for the night.  Sound quality, going through my Kindle Fire HD, is easily comparable to a good quality portable FM Radio.Still, I do not expect to use it very much.  I mostly use my Kindle at home and I prefer my home stereo system for music.  But it is nice to have in case I have it with me in an appropriate environment."

I've had it for almost 10 years so of course I had to add it to my new Kindle. Its FREE, and I love that I can have my own personal stations filled with music I like. I have a different station for every genre of music or mood I'm in. The thumbs up or down feature is really nice so I never have to hear a song I don’t like. Sure I could pay a fee to have the ads removed, but they only run about every 5th or 6th song and they’re short, not at all like on TV. So its worth it to me to have it for free."

As soon as I hit play, ""It was ON!""  My brother was singing, his roommate was singing, I was swaying and singing and even some of the nurses were swaying and singing.  We had a BLAST!!!  Nursing homes, are depressing places. But not that day; there was lot of spirit lifting going on.  Thank you Pandora for having the perfect selection of music."

Enjoy.....JoeUpdate:Noticed something that really pees me off!! In between songs or after ads I noticed songs listed as played that never played.You can't go back & play them,you can rate them.Just a bit aggravating when a sucky song comes on & a great song was skipped(not by me)!!!

"15596","Pandora","Edgy, Artistic Opportunity","Kevin L. Nenstiel","December 29, 2012",5,"Many prior reviewers have bemoaned the number of ads on Pandora stations, to which I reply: So? The ads are less frequent, less lengthy, and less disruptive than on a typical Clear Channel broadcast station. Considering the number and range of songs Pandora provides, and that royalties consume much more of digital radio's revenue than broadcast, I don't begrudge them paying for themselves. Since the ads aren't loud, I can handle a few interruptions.I'm more impressed by the fact that Pandora offers a wide array of music in nearly every genre, including music too edgy or dangerous for conglomerate-owned media outlets. Especially for those of us who live in the hinterlands, Pandora provides an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with music we would never otherwise encounter. I've been able to broaden my exposure to indie rock, international and ethnic music, daring composers, and innovative singer-songwriters.And getting it for my smartphone has been a real boost. I'm able to connect the provider to my car radio, the stereo at work, or my headphones, and carry my innovative music around with me. The sound is clear and translates well onto larger speakers, meaning I can enjoy it on my commute or my morning exercise regimen without having to accept diminished quality. Getting this for my phone has been a real blessing, one I intend to continue enjoying."
"15597","Pandora","Not only listening pleasure but discovery and knowledge","Mike Tarrani","October 2, 2013",5,"I'll attempt to not repeat what other reviews have said because there are nuances to Pandora that go beyond a convenient way to listen to the music you love.The first thing I love is the way artists whose work is related to your favorites that you specify in channels are slipped in. I have discovered more musicians (and albums) that I would have never thought of on my own through that feature.I also love that I can easily peruse a mini biography of the artist on any currently playing song, as well as features of the track itself. For example, listening to bassist Ron Carter's album titled Saguaro I discovered that the key features of the track for Piccolo include block chords on the piano and it's in a minor key. That information cues me to listen to those more carefully, which is a boon for musicians.Another feature with which I am currently experimenting is the connect-to-facebook link that will not only alert friends to what I am listening to (although I have that hidden using facebook's privacy settings), but a monthly summary of my listening habits published on my timeline. That I do find useful!The ads can be somewhat tiresome, but when I weight that minor inconvenience against the way Pandora's insertion of related music into my channel plays I can live with it with a smile. I have been exposed to a much wider range of music and artists than I ever was before Pandora came along, and this app is the key.For the record this review is of version 4.1.2, which is the latest as of the date of this review. Features may change, obviously, so take this date and version into consideration as you read this review."
"15598","Pandora","Pandora","EAlfaro","July 3, 2013",5,"I am technically ignorant and was very glad my children showed me how to have music at the touch of my hands anytime I wanted."
"15599","Pandora","Good free music app with lots of variety","Jamie E.","November 3, 2014",4,"Not a bad free music app.  You can select albums, artists etc to listen to.  Shuffle all of them or choice just tone to play.  You have no control over specific songs though.  Also they throw 'similar music' onto the station you are listening too.  Sometimes it is great, others can be disappointing.  However if you want only the one album of specific song this does not work so well.  If you do not like wha tis playing, you are limited to how many songs you can skip.  And there are a fair share of ad interruptions.  The other downside is that it takes a bit ti shut down the app and are constantly sending update notifications and thus far I have not figured out a way to stop them.But regardless, this is free and can still be great.  I use this on my phone and kindle so that when I am cleaning, exercising or outside I can enjoy my favorite music and overall there are less interruptions here than on a live radio station.  They have a good variety of music on it but seem limited to US artists so far mostly."
"15600","Pandora","Good app for an older streaming service","Melody","September 7, 2014",4,"What happened to Pandora?? I'm just cruising along with life when all of a sudden I realize how times have changed and Spotify seems bigger in the market than Pandora.  I feel like I just got old at the thought of how things have changed.But, this app holds up respectably in terms of ease of use and ability to stream music without lag.  I admit I have become more of a Spotify user myself, but for old times' sake, Pandora is just as great of a music streaming service.  The app performs decently as well."
"15601","Pandora","Why the Hate?","A.Searson","July 8, 2012",5,"I don't get all these comments about commercials every other song or other annoying things. This app works great for me on my Kindle Fire! I hardly ever hear a commercial- at most one per hour. I put in an artist that I love to be the station and so far it has given me a great variety. Also, I have not had problems with songs messing up when I am using another app- maybe the occasional tiny pause but that's it. Overall, I love this app and see no problems with it. :)"
"15602","Pandora","Best music service company bar none","Albert B.","September 30, 2017",5,"I have had Pandora Music Service for a number of years and am a regular subscriber. I think  Pandora is the best music service on the market. Music choice, ease of use, especially the ""quick mix option"", and the annual cost make it virtually unbeatable."
"15603","Pandora","Superb player held back by an American-style jumble of IP holders.","Amazon Customer","November 6, 2013",4,"I'd never be able to broaden my horizons if not for Pandora. I don't even bother with owning an archive anymore. However, the song selection is a bit limited, and some of the hoops Pandora has to jump through to keep its numerous license-holders happy end up putting odd quirks in the program. It will never be Spotify, but it's not enough to detract from the program, and Pandora One is dirt-cheap compared to other advertisement-free tiers in other programs.Despite any possible shadows of disadvantage, Pandora has changed my relationship with music."
"15604","Pandora","... long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up","Claire M","August 23, 2017",5,"It didn't take very long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up, a few thumbs down, and I have hours of the music that I want to hear (not what a local station thinks that I want to hear). The work goes faster and easier with Pandora - yard work, house work, and even re-roofing the house. Yes, 14 months spent re-roofing the house while listening to Pandora! It has my thumbs up."
"15605","Pandora","A Treasure Box of Music Just Waiting For You To Let Pandora Out of the Box","RonaldDerGrosse","May 8, 2016",5,"If you like music you can't beat this app. It plays only the types of music that you like to hear. If a choice of a song is not to your liking just give it a thumbs down and it is gone. I chose four different genres of music when I first got the app and listened for two hours and only snubbed two songs. I felt like it read my mind as to what I would play from my personal record collection. The ads are not that frequent  and do not last long either. Get this app now and you won't be sorry."

Since before it WAS Pandora and it was MSN Music, that's how long ago I've been a fan! I realize that there are other streaming music channels out there but when you achieve perfection, WHY switch?Thanks to Pandora, my work and personal life is so much richer. I have over 52 different channels on Pandora, from Patti Page, to Lionel Hampton, Pink Martini, Nils Frahm, Windham Hill, to 5 different Christmas stations (which I'm embarrassed to admit, I listen to throughout the year!). I have learned SO much more about the different genres that I enjoy, from Pop, Jazz, Blues, Alternative, Classical that Pandora should proudly take a bow, just on the education factor!If you go just a hare's breath beyond the standard listening feature, there's a wee box of ""arrows"" that you click so you can find out 1) Lyrics to most songs; 2) About the Artist; 3) WHY Pandora is using that particular artist i.e. ""Accoustic rhythm piano; intricate phrasing."" You also have the ability to ""Bookmark"" any song that you like, so you don't have to scramble for a pen/paper to remember ""Who WAS that awesome artist?""And, if you take the small effort to ""Thumb's Up/Down"" a song every now and then, Pandora can broaden their knowledge of your music and they add more songs of that ilk to your stations. Thank you, Pandora!Because I have a Zune membeship, what I do is take my bookmarked songs/artists and then investigate them further through Zune, usually downloading the entire album. A person can't be everywhere at one time and by listening to Pandora, I discover the ENTIRE world of music, not just the tiny part I know.And ""Yes!"", I'm a paid member for Pandora.One, a yearly Christmas gift I give myself and Pandora, applauding what they give to me, daily. Frankly, what else can you buy for less than a dime a day that delivers so much? :)"

For example if you like rap music and select Ice Cube radio it won't just play gangsta rap music it will play west coast rap music because Ice Cube is a west coast rapper.  The only downside is now this app is getting popular, being added to cars etc... so there are now commercials after 4-5 songs.  You have to purchase it to be commercial free."

We have paid the monthly fee so we don't get commercials… That’s the way to go if you listen to Pandora for any length of time.  It has lots of features.  Share the track you are currently listening to. Sleep timer function to shut off automatically. Bookmark a current track you are listening to.  Also, an option to buy the track if you like it that much.  Also, you can touch the picture and another screen opens from behind and allows you information about the artist, features of the track and lyrics. THAT is very cool.  Allows you to create as many stations as you like.  If you don't like a song in your genre then ""thumb it down"" and it should never play again. I think what I love the most about Pandora is it plays songs LIKE the play list I create and I find new songs to love all the time."

I'm not sure if it's just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on high(I have unlimited data, so it's not a problem for me). It's free so it's worth it but if you're thinking of getting Pandora One(Premium Membership) that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it's a lot better in my opinion."

You can rate a song with a thumbs down, and it will never play again on that song!

Don't cheat yourself; try this one!","Middle Man","November 22, 2013",5,"Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most, and it's commercial free (if you pay the modest $36.00 US or so per year).  Although you cannot at this time request a specific song, you'll get commercial-free tunes in any genre you choose.  I can't recommend Pandora highly enough.  If you're tired of normal radio, try Pandora.  You'll listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select, as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love.  It's almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go!  Try it....I'd be really surprised if you don't love it.  You define your stations however you'd like.  Then, shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be."
"15666","Pandora","Stations just plain missing the mark","Gene  A Vosteen","August 15, 2017",2,"Pandora is an OK service, but the ability to ""create a station"" is quite overblown.  When one creates a station with a (very) popular performer, that performer should be 50-70% (at least) of the songs played.  I often find that percentage down around 10-20%.  While I like being introduced to new artists that I might not have heard before, making them the most played is not what I am looking for.I can go to YouTube and get all the songs I want from any artist I want.That's the main reason I don't upgrade; it's not quite what I'm looking for.

Years ago when I first got it for my phone, I had a tedious desk job where the only thing you did all day was do the same repetitive data entry task, and so we were allowed to wear headphones. I paid the $4 a month (at the time that was the price - I'm not sure if that's changed) to take away the ads, and man was it worth it. Best $4 a month I'd ever spent.

I made a 6 hour car trip with a couple of my teenaged kids a while back and we listened to the same Pandora station for the whole drive and never had to skip a single song.

Works flawlessly now, stations will download automatically to so even connection issues don't usually stop the music. It's so much faster now it's amazing. High quality audio works now. The selection and rating system is the best I have tried in any music app. Suggestions are usually very good. Sometimes despite constant thumbs down it keeps playing certain things but that's not too often. Browse feature in Pandora one is so good. This really is the app of your a music lover and if you really are a music lover you have to get the paid version, the difference is amazing!"

You can set up individual radio stations for your favorite artist and Pandoras' software will follow the artist music types and play other artist that you probably never heard of. I have set up other stations from these Pandora suggestions and I am very happy with the results. The over the air radio stations are clueless on how to follow out the music types the public likes. I tracked over the air staions and they all have a 90 - 120 song rotation but Pandora is unlimited. Fantastic app."

You can create your on stations to your own personal music genre and like or dislike select songs that play randomly. The song that you have given thumbs up to starts to store on that particular station so it can play as often as you like. It's almost like creating your own CD, but, you can add more stations and add select artist to that one particular station of your choice. In my opinion this app is easy to use and plays awesome music!!!"

I was surprised to find it easy to use and it's free.  Not many bargains like this today.  You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day.  Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music.  You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song.  You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations.  Share your stations with others also.  What's not to like."

If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that isn't about that artist? O.o That fact is beyond "" Sloppy"" it's entirely Unprofessional!!!!3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? O.o So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program."

"15690","Pandora","it's no longer Plucky-Little-Pandora","Gregory","March 25, 2014",2,"I have subscribed to Pandora since they first offered package without ads - 2006 I believe - and listened for years before that. I have enthusiastically recommended the service to dozens and dozens of friends and even mere acquaintances; I figured I was doing them a good turn.NO MORE.Today's trigger was a Bait & Switch with the re-registration. The fee was listed a $3.99/month or $36/year, but only the one option in Google Play, a single button purchase at the monthly rate = $48 year. That's .33 more expensive than the listed annual rate.This is trickery and I take such details very seriously. It conveys to me that Pandora is now 1. a system that treats me disrespectfully and 2. it is run by those many now in business, who are consumed by avarice and greed.I know that businesses exist to make money and any service to consumers is only an epiphenomena, but this wasn't always the case with Pandora. It feels like a lose and makes me sad.But I could have live with this change. I did  find great new music. There it is a far more sinister aspect Brave-New-Pandora: it is data mining all aspects of users' choice of music..............[...]Mr. Bieschke (Pandora's chief scientist) says ""We take all of these signals and look at correlations that lead us to come up with magical insights about somebody.""People's music, movie or book choices may reveal much more than commercial likes and dislikes. Certain product or cultural preferences can give glimpses into consumers' political beliefs, religious faith, sexual orientation or other intimate issues. That means many organizations now are not merely collecting details about where we go and what we buy, but are also making inferences about who we are....Out of $427.1 million in revenue in the 2013 fiscal year, advertising generated $375.2 million..............Just what, in fact is Pandora's business?It just creeps me out that my music is being used to profile me.I've uninstalled the app."
"15691","Pandora","Gives me more of what I value...","Jim Worthy","September 7, 2013",5,"If you love music and discovering new music, Pandora is the single best reason for broadband access.I listen to music every day. My musical tastes are diverse and I love to discover new artists. Until now, I've listened via my computer at home and work. I spend a fair amount of time on the road and I just purchased a smartphone primarily so I can listen to Pandora on the go.I realize other people value different experiences and functions but, for me, this new phone and app added a large measure of joy to my mobile days.As far as the app itself, I just started using it so I've got an impression, not an opinion. I need more time and data for that. However, it works similarly to the desktop app and browser versions. I haven't run across a big hurdle yet."

"15696","Pandora","Great!","Ciera","December 30, 2012",5,"I love that you can choose what type of music or the artist you want to hear. It will play for a long time and just in case there are no interruptions, the app will ask if you are still listening. At which point, you can choose to keep listening or stop until the next time. Furthermore, the sound is excellent. I never have any glitches, or issues that prevent me from listening. The ads in between several songs catch you off guard, but its like radio, without the characters. The ads come and go and you're back to listening to your music preference. I recommend this app to all music lovers for anytime use!"
"15697","Pandora","The leader is falling behind","TW Brown, Author, Editor, and Reviewer","January 8, 2013",3,"When I first discovered Pandora, I absolutely  loved it. However, over time, the ""stations"" became the same songs in the same rotation. I am somebody who listens to music 10+ hours a day. It got so that I could hear the next song coming before it played. While they started off well and had a great selection...I have migrated to Spotify. You can customize your playlist, and I have found some wonderfully obscure artists there. Pandora might become to streaming music what the VHS was to home video. It was good for its time, but easily replaced."

I didn't realize that I had to sell my soul to do so! This app bombarded me with ads and forces you to sign in with your email address just to use it. They want to get you to buy the paid version, and it has limited options to listen to your preferred artist. It also clips the ends of many songs which I hate.The permissions list for this app is just crazy. Why should a radio app gain access to my personal data, modify my calendar and send email to guests and read my contact data. That is exceptionally invasive and I don't want to share that data with someone's server.Here is a list of the permissions on my Amazon Kindle.* Network communication - full internet access and create Bluetooth connections* Your personal information - add or modify calendar events and send email to guests, read contact data* Storage - modify delete internal storage contents* Kindle calls - read Kindle state and identity* System tools - Bluetooth administration, change WIFI state prevent kindle from sleeping* Network communication - view network state, view WIFI state* System tools - automatically set start at bootI just found the app to not work very well, not have the controls I wanted and its invasion of my data was over the top of what I thought was necessary to listen to the radio.

I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad 1 - was that 6 years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every 6 or 7 songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the $4 a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down."

The stations' music selections are too commercial and repetitive. I listen to classical, so why do I have to keep hearing Vivaldi's "" the seasons"" every day? How about some in depth recordings of certain composers on different days?"
"15795","Pandora","What a Find!","Gaye Goodman","August 22, 2014",4,"I am a ""senior citizen"" and new to the idea of sampling music online. My tastes range from Portuguese fado and neo tango music to Brian Eno & Harry Partch. In one week of happily skipping about Pandora, I have only found ONE composer they could not locate.I'm not wild about the occasional car ads, but that is a small price to pay for the pleasure and education Pandora has afforded me. Three cheers for this new-fangled technology, which is also intuitive and easy to use!"
"15796","Pandora","Great app loved it but theres  just one thing.....read on","mary reinemer","January 23, 2014",4,"I love this app. There is only one thing that is really  makes me mad is that sometimes it plays artists I didn't download. But just get it it's really good but just that one thing I'm not trying to make you not buy it."

I actually have thought of getting the Ad-Free Pandora One, but am not ready to pay $4.99 a month yet. I'm such a cheapskate. I probably will once I get more gadgets that will allow me to use Pandora. Once that happens it's totally worth it because your linked to your own account no matter what gadget your using at the time. Go Pandora !"

"15799","Pandora","Your dream stations","howard","May 19, 2016",5,"It's free, with only three or four ads per hour. You pick an artist and it sets up a channel playing music by them or in a similar genre. What's to complain about?"
"15800","Pandora","I love Pandora!","Beverly Lynnt","March 7, 2013",5,"I love this app. You can move around on the carousel and even read books while listening to your favorite music. The only thing I don't like so far, is that I have been notified that they will charge for any amount of listening over 40 hours/mo. I don't think that is right, because I already have an account with Pandora through our Netflix account. So it should be covered already. I know it imported all my ""stations"" from that account. If you have an account with Netflix, be aware of this. It might be a new policy. I don't know."

I doubt that Pandora will be around for long."

I wasn't a fan that you were still limited with how many songs you could skip but I can deal.For the past three months Ive had ongoing issues with one of my stations that should be playing Today's Hits... normally it plays the newest hits that you find on the current radio and new music. Lately its been playing weird folk music. I've sent numerous emails and have gotten responses ranging from ""we're sorry"" to ""its working as expected"", well its not working as expected. I shouldn't have to thumbs down the same songs more than once on the same station... twice in a row, I shouldn't have to thumbs down it more than once ever on the same station. they seem to hope Ill just give up.My thought is if I'm paying 5 a month for something I expect you to make an effort to fix the issue. Its only one station with the issue, and I cant even delete the station and set it up again... it simply opens the old one back up.Come on Pandora, you can do better. Your service has gone downhill."

It's better than I Heart Radio by a landslide! Any station you can think of, Pandora has it!! It isn't like a real broadcast radio station, but if you type in something like Today's Adults Hits, all that station plays is today's hits! If you don't have the paid version (4 dollars a month) however, it has some ads. Oh, and another thing. You will get a lot ofE-mails telling you what songs you like (they would know because there is an option of 4 buttons, one is Like, one is Dislike-automatically skips song- skip, and pause) and what new songs are for the season. I like the e-mails, however, even if you hate e-mails. Well, I don't have the paid version, and I think it's amazing! Seriously, get the app!

Now it looks like you have to pay to get that quality.  That stinks.  When I pay I would hope they at least stream at 320 kbps.  Really, they should stream lossless as an option in the settings.  It's like paying for satellite radio.  Why would I when the quality is set so low?  Everyone has just gotten away from really listening to albums because there way too much loss at these qualities.  Pandora, please upgrade to a higher streaming kbps.  Otherwise, I'll never pay for it.  You are now asking us to pay for 192, when you used to offer it free.  What's the incentive then?  None."

The tablet app is so easy to use and makes listening to my favorite songs very enjoyable. I have 5 ""radio"" stations setup and switching between them give me the songs for those different moments. I don't even need the DELUXE version since the short 30 second adds are far less than any radio. I think they ""interrupt"" less because I rate each of the songs as I listen and relax.

I have selected about 25 of my favorite artists and with each artist you get other artists that compliment each other.

"15907","Pandora","Gotta Luv It!! Pandora: A Critical Review","Andre Lawrence","June 22, 2012",5,"This is by far one of the best mobile app's out there.I've been using Pandora daily and what's great about the mobile app (as opposed to the desktop version) is that there's no break in the playlist.  Sure, you have advertisements that pop up every few minutes but that's a small price to pay.  Everything else is great, great selection and ever-increasing song list and the ability to switch channels when I want to hear something else.  I don't particularly like ""mixing"" radio stations but that my preference and I can control that.Pandora radio for mobile.  5 stars."

You pick your song and it just seems to know what you want to listen to. It's super user friendly and spot on with my selections. Very pleased with this app. I have a Galaxy S6."
"15911","Pandora","REALLY like it!","RWingo","December 8, 2015",5,"Really like the categories and source selection opportunities. The only thing I don't care too much for is you are limited to skipping ahead or 'thumbs down'. Once I figured it out, I just used another category to fine tune my selections. Great for traveling!"

"15914","Pandora","I love their service","B. Clark","April 25, 2015",5,"Pandora has helped me learn about and share new music for years, now. I love their service. I use it all the time.

"15915","Pandora","highly recommend","Tirado Family","January 6, 2015",5,"For main words: Three Dog Night Radio!!!Oh my goodness, I am loving this app! I can't get enough of it.

But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I don't want to use it because I don't have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app"
"15917","Pandora","Love Pandora!","RENport AL","July 5, 2015",4,"We use Pandora all the time and have for years. Fantastic music service, creates play lists based on a favorite song, artist, genre.

There is music for every genre that I can customize for whatever mood I'm into for the moment.  It's nice to be able to listen to music when you're away from home. You can bring a little comfort into a motel and relax and listen to music you like and it's always good.Pandora is a great station."

"15922","Pandora","Indispensable semi-passive music listening tool!","Thomas T.","September 8, 2017",5,"Pandora is a great concept, and nicely executed. I learned how to use it and am now addicted! I really like the idea of encountering random tracks that fit into a self-created 'station' idea that I didn't choose directly. I'm still learning how to use its management capabilities, but I've come to use it quite a lot, as over the air radio in non-urban areas (heck, even in urban areas!) leaves a lot to be desired these days. Try it, learn it, you'll love it!"

Add to the limited skipping of unwanted selections, it was a no-brainer not to renew this after my year expired. I did discover Ulrich Strauss, for which I'll be eternally grateful :-)."
"15925","Pandora","Not worth getting","Amazon Customer","January 25, 2014",2,"I have been a longtime Pandora One subscriber. Until recently, I have made the jump to Sirius XM satellite radio. Why? Much more variety. Not to mention 160+ live channels. All music channels can be catered to the end user's taste with MyXM it has 6 skips an hour limit, but doesn't make me feel bad. Because there is always something new to listen to. Pandora has become stale. If I Don't suggest a new artist the station keeps playing the same stuff over and over again. Sirius is worth the dough."
"15926","Pandora","Great way to hear new music!","Judson Roberts","September 22, 2013",4,"I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works, but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out, I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres."
"15927","Pandora","Too many commercials.","Ricus Arkright","December 22, 2015",3,"While Pandora is nice, the free version plays a hundred times more ads than Spotify. Spotify also offers full minute commercials and then plays for half an hour. I do like how I can filter out explicit content, which is something I cannot do on Spotify."

There is no cost to listen and enjoy unless you choose to upgrade. I like to be able to listen to a variety of Gospel music such as Country/Southern, Black Gospel and some more modern. It allows me to select, and then just run the shuffle of music to get the variety. Also I like to use it at school at times in my K2 class, using Christian Childrens music in our Christian school."
"15930","Pandora","I seriously love this","Happy","May 27, 2013",5,"When I was younger I would only really listen to whatever people happen to give to me, which was usually pop stuff given to me by my older sister. Now that I'm branching out more and finding my own music I find pandora to be pretty great for new suggestions. Music by people I'd never heard of before or even songs that I loved but hadn't heard in forever and didn't know or forgot the names of have been suggested to me and there's nothing quite like finding a long lost song to make your day. :)"

I was not overly impressed with the Kindle version. It only wants to show the history of the group or artist. Where is the lyrics? I like to see the lyrics sometimes and it is fun to see what they really say as opposed to what people think.... Like I do sometimes."
"15939","Pandora","great app","Shell46","February 14, 2014",5,"I love that I can type in a band that I love and it finds others similar for me!  makes it alot easier to find music you enjoy and it has the thumbs up or down so that if you really like a song just hit the thumb up and it will play songs similar to its type and if you don't then it the thumbs down!  You can add as many bands to the same radio channel as you want and it will shuffle all of those bands for you.  I just love it!"

No way to turn the app off , you have to pause the playing which leaves the app running but not playing.  I got an email from Pandora wanting to know what I was doing with the app running on 3 devices. I guess they think i'am passing it around!!  Pandora offered the option to install the App on other devices.  A good little fix would be a stop button on the App.  Oh by the way I'm a paying customer!"
"15942","Pandora","Almost 5 stars - but my station gets invaded frequently with offensive music","Gabriela Mistral","July 12, 2014",4,"I love Pandora and listen to it all the time, on my computer, my Ipad and especially my Sonos system. For the latter, it is pretty seamless and the ads in the free version are not terribly intrusive. The sound quality is great, and I usually (but not always) get music I enjoy.That said, Pandora seems a bit confused about what I call my Uplifting music station. Most of the time it works great. I get my favorite kinds of music consisting of Kirtan, Irish piano riffs and some beautiful, moving classical music. But at least once a day, my happy reverie is invaded when suddenly I am bombarded with loud and offensive rap music such as Moki complete with swear words. What the @#$*&^?? I always give these a thumbs down and the specific song goes away, only to have some other piece pop its head in the following day or even immediately after! Makes me wonder what it is about my other song choices that feeds into Pandora's algorithm fooling it into picking something so off the wall. Just curious - and mildly annoyed. And yeah, it is free so I give it ALMOST 5 stars."
"15943","Pandora","Works for me","mushi","February 18, 2013",4,"I am still new to the touch screen stuff so am still learning how to touch the screen. Previous to getting the Kindle I accessed Pandora with a PC. The web browser interface has lots more flexibility. However, for use on Kindle the one-touch simpler interface is OK for listening in the back yard and around the house. As advertised the Kindle sounds great playing pandora and sounds even better with Bose headphones plugged in. My pandora lists are vocalists and instrumentals, no heavy rock or hip-hop with heavy bass."

EVER!But the variety of music is impressive and  again--IT'S FREE!"
"15945","Pandora","like, not love","seriously reviewed reviews","January 26, 2015",4,"I like pandora. It gives you the option of likeing or dislikeing, skipping a song, looking at previously herd songs, and making different personalized radio stations. Only problem: it can play really cool songs, and it can play really, really bad songs that you won't know why pandora thought you'd like. Overall though, it's pretty cool."

"15949","Pandora","Impressed me to tears :)","Cthulhu","October 28, 2011",5,"I am happy now. Now that Pandora's free membership comes with unlimited playback I want Pandora everywhere and, thanks to this, Pandora is on my XOOM now.Pandora is elegant and flawless on Honeycomb. The screen is less cluttered than the PC version with nothing but the album cover, the thumbs up/down icons, an 'info' button that opens up artist and song info screens and the playback controls. I like that option to blank the screen while layback continues. And Pandora keeps playing while other apps are in use - tried it with the browser and a couple of games.The Android settings menu allows you to tweak a few parameters:- Play quality high/normal- Auto screen lock on/off- Auto shutdown in low memory situations- Bluetooth on/offIt's perfection (with some ads popping up).-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<"

"15952","Pandora","stop wasting your time and go to spotify.","Mitchyslick","May 30, 2015",1,"Spotify is WORLDS better and the premium is a rip off! $4.99 a month!? It's barely worth a lifetime membership for $4.99 and the only reason I was signed up is because I accidentally tapped to close to sign up instead of no thanks on the free version and there was conveniently no ""are you sure"" screen next just went right ahead and signed me up for an auto renewing membership.  Canceling it is not as simple as one easy click.  It can be tricky to find where to cancel your membership once your signed up if your not to families with whatever device you are running it on.  I used to enjoy the free version but didn't like having no choice in what actually played after seeing what little difference the premium version makes for the price I will never be on pandora again even if the premium was free."
"15953","Pandora","Pandora App","LD Hay","August 2, 2013",5,"Awesome app.  Downloaded it for use on my kindle fire and it works great.  Although there are several competitors out there including Apple's (a direct shameful pandora rip off that would never have seen the light of day if Steve Jobs were still alive) and I heart radio; Pandora has been around for over a decade and they are simply the best.  They have tried and true algorithms and the more you use it the better it gets.  Far and away the best. I definitely recommend."
"15954","Pandora","Used to be very good!","onephatguy","December 6, 2012",3,"Not sure what has happened to Pandora, but the annoying way the ads are, and the amount, are terrible.  I used to be jealous of all the people at work with Pandora when all I had was Slacker on my Windows phone.  I now have the Droid Razr Maxx HD and have Pandora, Slacker, and Iheart Radio.  I have to say I am not jealous anymore.  This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed:  1.  Slacker  2.  Iheart Radio  3.  Pandora  Luckily all these apps are free so you can try them yourself and decide which is best for you."

You basically have to add an artist to the station to get some fresh songs in there, but even then it gets a little stale after a while.  However, it's free and it works.  The stream does not get interrupted unless you have a really weak signal.  It's a great way to hear some new music or artists you were otherwise not familiar with."

"15970","Pandora","Does what I have always wanted to do with my music","Kindle Customer","November 7, 2012",5,"This service has been able to do what I have always wanted to do with music; create and play dynamic playlists. The parameters that they assign music allows users to create stations and focus the dynamics of the playlist as one listens.  It can focus to a such a fine degree to where I have to delete stations and re-create them just to expand the music content. I run this on PC's, media players and tablets. My music collection has been off loaded. The subscription cost is very reasonable and makes the music seamless for hours."

Having it loaded on my Android smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD is even better.  Able to play my stations in the kitchen the bedroom, the car and anywhere is fabulous.  The user interface is good and easy to figure out.  The only issue I have is that the touch buttons are so small on the screen it is hard to hit them accurately.  For example, the X that you use to close an advertisement and the menu to quit or change stations.  But other than that, it works like a charm.  I am a big fan of Pandora as a way to listen to music."

When I type in an artists it does a pretty good job of giving me things I would/could like.

Overall, it is a great app and I would certainly recommend it to my family and friends. The one thing I do not like is how it goes idle after a period of time.

If a tune comes on that you don't care for, simply click on the ""thumbs-down""icon, and another song in the genre you have selected begins to play. If you tire of one type of music, simplyclick and select a new one."
"16093","Pandora","Best way to find new music","picky!!!","May 25, 2014",5,"Pandora is great because you hear artists you wouldn't have otherwise, based on your preferences. I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and thrives on finding new artists and genres. My only problem with it is that there are more ads than there used to be and the price of a subscription to get rid of the ads has gone up. However, it is only $4.99/mo, which is affordable and worth the expense."

"16106","Pandora","I love it","Jason S.","March 14, 2014",5,"I love Pandora because it is like public radio, but you can choose what you like and if you don't like a song you can just skip it or dislike it and it skips the song and will not play the song again on the station you disliked it on. Ads aren't too often every 7 or so songs and after skips. If you hats ads you can always get Pandora one, which gives you additional skips, No ads, and on the website you can choose a custom background for $3.99 a month. One downside is I can't use the alarm clock feature because battery life on my kindle fire is really bad on wifi even on standby. I love the sleep time because sometimes I need something to turn off my music if I do fall asleep to help save me from being waken up to turn off the ""loud music"". I don't use the station shuffle much, but it is a cool feature which plays a different station after each song and you can go back to one station play by clicking the station you want."

If you do it long enough most of the music that you here will be ones that you like.  Since I have loaded Pandora I have almost never turn on television but I do love music.  It is simple to figure out easy to understand all you have to do type in a favorite artist or style of music and let it pick the music, all you have to do is give it a thumbs up ( I like it) or thumbs down (I don't like it)  It is worth the download.

"16124","Pandora","Still my favorite Internet Radio","Amazon Customer","September 22, 2013",5,"Sure Spotify and Rdio have the social element but music is more personal for me and I'll admit, I am not too involved in socialnetworks. Pandora constantly adjusts and updates music and while it can take a while to curate your station, I still get a random mix of songs I like. I rather like the genre and atmosphere, depending on my mood or what I am doing as opposed to selecting artists."

"16126","Pandora","Pandora is awesome.","Gary Smith","November 26, 2012",5,"In the area I live, finding a good Contemporary Christian radio station can be difficult. Everything is either a little too country or a little too pop sounding. What I like most about Pandora is that I can tailor it to my taste and don't have to sit through a few songs I don't particularly like to hear one I do like. And I really enjoy that I can create a few different stations to go with the mood I am in on any given day. And if I really love a song I hear it is easy to purchase. I would rate Pandora more stars if possible."
"16127","Pandora","Great music - few commercials!","Sharon","January 31, 2014",5,"One of the best qualities about Pandora is that they play other music in the genre you've chosen, and this exposes the listener to music they might never have heard or been familiar with.  The other bonus is being able to listen to a certain type of music on demand and then switch to totally different kind when the mood strikes.  I have at least 5 ""options"" I choose from.  Plus, my children can have their own ""stations"" when they are on the computer."

"16132","Pandora","Good for background music","QueenB","June 8, 2013",4,"I have Pandora on my Kindle Fire and I use it as background music when I am entertaining so I don't have to figure out what music to play. So far I have only 1 station - cool jazz. I used the thumbs up, thumbs down option and I plan to do more with Pandora when I have more time. I'm not sure if it's my Kindle or Pandora -- after the music has been playing for a while the screen goes black and I can't change anything any more. The music keeps playing for a while and eventually if you don't tell it anything it stops because it thinks you're not listening anymore."

Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play.  There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another (although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora).  If a song comes on you don't like, just hit skip and it will never be played again.  I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"

"16151","Pandora","Amazing breadth of music.","jbolernc","December 27, 2013",5,"I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer.  I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it wouldn't take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up.  Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound.  I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour.  I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to ""design"" a station."

Of course the ads are a bit bothersome but it's free.  Sometimes a song comes on I am not fond of so I skip it - can't do that on the radio and it's still free.  I love Pandora.  The variety available just by entering an artist's or group's name is amazing - even somewhat obscure names will bring a good mix of music in that genre or style."

Uses very little cellular data which is excellent.  I have the free version; there are commercials, but I don't mind as they are way less frequent than commercial radio.I no longer have 15 minutes of talk during my 20 min drive to work -- can listen to more upbeat stuff to wake me in the morning, podcasts for interesting stuff, and more mellow favorites as I de-stress on the drive home."

I originally subscribed to Pandora on my computer and really don't plan on using it on my Kindle. If there is any downside to Pandora it is that there is not as much variety as I would like.

"16186","Pandora","Pandora often over promises and under delivers.","Penny Cunningham","January 1, 2015",2,"Pandora seems fine as long as your taste in music runs to current and popular works.  If you want something more eclectic, not so hot.  Or perhaps they're targeting people under 40, with only lip service to older demographics.  The diversity of content of people who want music that was popular prior to 1980 is fairly sparse, and basically lumped together based on the year rather than format.  There's just no other explanation for putting Jerry Lee Louis and Dean Martin on the same play list supposedly geared to 1950s rock n roll.  Of course, you can ""skip"" the Dean Martin song, but if you also skip the Frank Sinatra and Perry Como songs that immediately follow, you exceed your ""skip"" quotient with the ""free"" version.  Basically, even with contemporary music, I find their alogrithms in need of either code writers with a better understanding of the various music genres or much tighter parameters.  I have seen very little improvement in this during the past 5 years with ""stations"" I try to construct, so it gets longer and longer between the times I actually use Pandora.  Do have to say that their ""Rockin Holidays Radio"" station pretty much delivered on its promise, so there is someone in programming that ""gets it.""  Hopefully that person will have a larger role in the overall experience going forward."

"16203","Pandora","I don't know how I lived without it","Kaspasia","January 20, 2013",5,"Pandora makes listening to music such a pleasure. It isn't perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I don’t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you don't want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music I’m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For $36 a year you can’t beat it. Music you (mostly) love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing he’s doing it and it drives me nuts!"

It seems they have rectified that situation and all is good now. I can drive just about anywhere and have my music playing non-stop.A couple of things for them to think about. I would like to see the ads more geared towards the particular user that is listening to music... one that listens to 'nature' or 'classical' is a different creature than one that listens to 'rap', 'rock', 'pop', etc. Regional ads would be great too. I would love to know that my local convenience store that is just down the street is having a sale on some widget.All in all it was a rocky start and I went back to listening to other services for a while until Pandora got their act together and got an update out that fixed their problems. Since then... smooth sailing.Pandora ROCKS!"

Now its everywhere, in my kindle, my iPhone, and even in a program form for my PC. Its my favortite App and Music Player. I have various moods for music, and by the entry of one song for the mood I'm in, it instinctivly plays other songs around that genre and style. Like sometimes I'm in the Lady Gaga mood, and then I listen to main stream dance pop for the evening. Other times I want to hear some Nickleback or Papa Roach, and then I am jamming to that and all simular songs. Another perk is it plays current new 'in' songs from that genre so I do get exposed to fresh music around my favorites selections, so its always expanding my musical horizons as well as keeping me saticfied with what ever mood I am in at the moment. I pay the anual fee for several years now, because.... who wants commercials? Why not pay them to help them operate their service, instead of letting advertizing agencies pay them and force their product in my face? I never hear commercials, which is one reason why I canceled my Satilight Radio service and switched to Pandora. ALSO it's MUCH cheaper annually than XM Radio, and can be heard on any internet device, unlike XM Radio, where only on registered devices. This is a great internet radio service :)"

But, if I did, Pandora would be the first App I'd put on it. (I'm here investigating it for a friend.)Pandora is the best thing to happen to music since the electric guitar was invented. I use it almost every day - at work on my PC or my iPod, at home on my TiVo HD (over my home audio system where it sounds awesome), and on the road over my Android phone. It takes a little tuning to create unique, individual stations. You have to carefully choose seed songs & artists and ""thumb up"" songs that match the station concept and ""thumb down"" songs that don't, even it you like the song. Otherwise, all of your stations start to sound alike.Create one variety station where you ""thumb up"" everything you like and ""thumb down"" everything you don't like and Pandora will zero in on exactly what your kind of music is (and even describe it to you). That will be your favorite station (like having your own personal radio station). But also, create different stations for different moods or situations and ""prune"" them (using the web site) by removing songs from the ""thumbs up"" that don't belong there when a station starts to drift too much.I pay the small annual fee to get no commercials. worth every penny."

The ads are obnoxious, though - not only do you have to listen to them but they pop up in app and are very easy to inadvertently trigger. Really guys? Can't just pick one way for ad delivery? Also kind've lame considering you, Pandora, do not pay a lot of the artists for the media usage rights, but we'll just see how the court case pans out on that one.

So those are my current formats on Pandora! ""Followers"" can listen in, too. (I don't mean Facebook; Pandora has their own system.) Pandora's computers play stuff for you based on your initial stated preference of artist or song each time you're in the mood for something you haven't been listening to on Pandora yet.  And you are able to vote each song up or down, or to skip the current piece. It's basically an interactive music collection, vastly larger than the records or tapes or discs you could or would store at home. OTOH it doesn't make you assemble and buy song by song like for your own iPod® either. They've scientifically analyzed recorded music based on elements like tempo, culture, mood, rhythm, instrumentation, even key, time signature, etc., and base their choices for you on the characteristics contained in your first choice, as well as on your subsequent votes. (They really want your votes too. If you go too long without voting, they'll stop and post a notice making sure you're still listening, and remind you they can't afford ""playing to an empty room""!)The free service includes audio and even video commercials, even ones local to your market. I don't usually mind, in fact, as an old radio hand, I like how ""stop-sets"" break it up a little, especially in the absence of DJs or news. Some ads are targeted for your gender, too. But I heard a political ad recently, which I felt violated the mood. Also, sometimes songs or ads get cut off. And they do warn you this can chew up alot of your monthly MBs or GBs. You can pay to stop the ads and improve sound quality even more than what I find perfectly adequate for my laptop or tablet speakers, currently $36US/year IIRC, and I might do that, as this US election year promises/threatens to carpet-bomb us with ads of the worst kind yet.If your screen is big enough they also send, with each song as it's playing, album art, artist information if available, and the scientific reasons why they think this song fits your format (though I'm not sure ""headnodic"" is a word!!). So I've learned a lot about music I've always wondered about... without the financial pain of buying discs or songs blindly.One thing you can't do is request *by* format or scientific characteristic. I'm part Native American, but city-raised, so I just typed that into the box; but if you don't know an artist or song title, the system can't help you.You can also get the service through [...], without this app, but I don't know how that would work out on a smaller device.Long story short, this may be the future of music radio -- ""narrowcasting,"" even self-help."

The only issue is that about half the time when I turn it on, it quickly shuts back off and I have to restart it (then it stays on), but I don't find that too be a huge issue. It is more pleasing to use and look at on my Kindle than it is on my PC.  I really like it."

One just cannot beat it for the price."

The iOS Pandora app is far more attractive, why not give the kindle the same sort of sleek offerings instead of something that looks like an afterthought?The kindle fire he app store has been so disappointing in general."
"16399","Pandora","incredible music collection.","Amazon Customer","May 2, 2014",5,"Whatever you want to hear, Pandora has it and will play it for you for free.

Its my own personalized radio. it plays every song you can think of.so you make your own radio by typing in an artist/song and it creates it, then it also plays other similar artists. and you can add as many different artists on one radio you want, or you can make as many individual  radios as you want also."
"16404","Pandora","Too time consuming.","Richard Flannigan","December 26, 2014",1,"In spite of any ads for Pandora, song selections are limited. Stations must be ""tuned in."" To get a station to lat the music you want it is necessary to pay attention to what you are playing, reject songs not of that artist or genre, and accept songs that are appropriate."

It has a huge verity of music and artists. It does a good job of guessing what other music I like and gives me 100 different artists or playlists at a time in my library to chose from.

Any stations you create or songs that you rate on the mobile will be integrated with your computer stations so you don't have to miss a step.  Next time you log on to your computer it will be right there.  Or vice versa. Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web.  But they're short compared to commercial radio.  And you can always upgrade ($36 per year at this time) and you won't hear any ads at all.

"16459","Pandora","Music your way.","Inzider Z","May 18, 2012",5,"This review is for those who are not yet familiar with Pandora. Once you create an account, it is like running your own radio station. You create your own channels by typing in an artist's name, such as ""Beatles"". You now have a channel that plays ramdom Beatles songs mixed in with songs from similar artists like The Rolling Stones and The Who. The basic application has no fees, and in my experience only throws in a 20-30 second commercial after every 15 to 20 songs. Pretty darn good for free! I don't know if there is a limit to the number of channels you can create, but I have at least 30 of them. One of the best benefits of Pandora is being 'turned onto' artists that you didn't know about, that are similar to some of your favorites. All your channels are saved online and connected to your account, so they can be accessed on all your devices (computer, tablet, net box, smart phone, etc.) without having to recreate them. If you're a music lover, this is the BEST free service on the internet."

It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I've experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network, location, and signal strengthThe interface is very user-friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar -thumbs up, thumbs down, pause, stations, and next. On the top right corner, there is an ""i,"" which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to look at the lyrics.For the most part, the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers, highs and lows are still distinct. It's not the best, but definitely passes for radio quality.Still a solid option for music streaming."

So yeah this app is better on a tablet or a phone with a huge screen so it doesn't cover the whole screen...but otherwise it's awesome. Doesn't really lag unless it's having a bad day...Galaxy Express i437"
"16544","Pandora","Would be five stars but for one feature (Updated:loses a star!)","The Weekly Reader","January 16, 2012",5,"Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while doing other things like reading or browsing the web.  This review is more for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already.  If you already don't like Pandora for whatever reason, you're not going to like the app, obviously.Previously gave it 3 stars for lack of certain features like the ability to edit the Shuffle.  Used to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the ""QuickMix"" station list, especially considering that my preferred device for Pandora, my Kindle Fire, would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora.com on the silk browser.  Recent updates have added this missing functionality and more nice features--which seemed to have made it hang up once in a while, but that got fixed too-- and the Pandora app is now everything I wanted from it, so it has earned two more stars!  Way to go, it is about time!"

It is perfectly integrated with their online system already set-up, so if you are plugged in online in a browser this application works great.Problems you'll find if you use the free version of Pandora:-The advertisements frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and are hard to close but easy to open.-You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station (where music comes from such as artists, songs, e.g.)*EDIT*-It is not possible to get a scrolling list of previously played music.  You can only view the one you are listening to at the moment.^ This is now possible.  They have fixed it and made the application even better.My qualms with the application, but it is good nonetheless."

"16632","Pandora","FREE: HALF TRUE","vivian jones","December 30, 2013",1,"I loved  the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not  frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE"" so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount  of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I  was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you've ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life  now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I don't have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that's an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again ""for free"" I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their  free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned  that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start  up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being  deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was  free  and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a  solution that would allow someone  who  had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I don't wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who don't use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would  even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so  quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year  I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information.  It's a shame we couldn't work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."

Enough about that. I have really enjoyed making stations and listening to music I would play if I had it, much of which I do own now. The links to buy the music make it simple to expand your collection.I like being able to insert comments and read what others think about the songs and artists.I got this app for my Mom's i-pad and it doesn't have half the flexibility as the one for the Kindle. I even got her Pandora One thinking it would add more usefulness, it didn't.My only complaint is there is only three ratings for the songs; like (thumbs up), dislike (thumbs down), and neutral (do nothing). I wish there was a really, really, really (you get the idea) like the song."

"16706","Pandora","Not Customer Friendly","Becca","July 12, 2012",3,"My Pandora was working wonderfully for awhile. I constantly heard a song that I had ""thumbed up"" so I decided to ""thumb down"" it. It skipped and within half and hour I heard the song AGAIN. If you thumb down a song its supposed to never show back up. Also, it seems that there is a limited amount of thumbed up songs you can have. My biggest complaint is that the app signed me up for the free trial of Pandora One without my permission.  I wasnt going to use the free trial until commercials and all the things Pandora One gets rid of really started to annoy me. This app is slow on my phone (Motorola Defy) and drain my battery on it and my kindle fire. I have to listen to music to go to sleep to block out noises (I use earbuds too), so I truly have no other choice."

I have the iPhone with me everywhere, which I definitely cannot say about my desktop, so with this app I am using Pandora far more than I ever did before.As for Pandora itself, I like that I can set up many different ""channels,"" and Pandora will play a constant stream of similar types of music within a given channel.

I even paid the fee to get the enhanced service without commercials and longer stretches of music. Maybe its because I started listening to it more often at work that I started noticing this: Pandora regularly cuts off songs before they're over. At first I thought they were just chopping off a few seconds at the end, but today they cut off a four minute song after playing it for only 30 seconds. I've really noticed this when trying to use their shuffle feature - it seems a lot worse there.When I first found Pandora I thought it was awesome. But the whole point of it is listening to songs you like, and a service that cuts off songs you like while you're right in the middle of listening to them - it's becoming highly irritating. In the end, great idea, but I can't recommend them. Certainly not for money, and if people just want to listen for free, well, you get what you pay for."

Lets say you like Queen, The Beatles, or Insane Clown Posse. Type the name of any band in, and you can listen to that band and other bands like the band you typed in. If you listen to ICP expect to hear Boondox, Twiztid, Cypress Hill, and much more. For another instant if you listen to The Beatles, expect to get Beach Boys, the Byrds, Dave clarck 5 and many more 60's bands. Last example is Queen. On the Queen station expect to hear, Boston, Adam and the ants, Electric Light Orchestra, and more great 70-80's bands."

My first use was on their mobile app. It took me a little bit of time to learn how to signup and setup my account, and it was a bit annoying, however after that the experience was great. The technology behind Pandora really predicted some really great music for me. I really loved how I could discover new tracks. In fact, even though other services have other features, thus far, Pandora has helped me discover the most music. The app feels solid, nothing brilliant, but it does what I want it to do, play music. It has a modern look, with slight bugs but it doesn`t really matter. Great service, and must try app!"

Just this morning Pandora crashed on my phone five times before playing a full song, and the night before was a constant crashing battle on my tablet.  Then the ads for the nonpaid version are overwhelming, and all too often uninteresting material, but the full version is now FAR too expensive for what little control the user actually has for me to even consider paying.  I used to love Pandora."
"16794","Pandora","Love!","A. White","May 5, 2013",4,"One of my favorite apps. Only negative things I can this of are that the thumbs down, and up are close by each other, so toddlers accidently press the wrong button. Also, it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic, or live versions right after the original recording of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip more songs, and not have to pay to get rid of adds, but it is understandable, and could be worse with them. They aren't as easy to accidently hit as on some apps, but I did still pay to not have them. I think it was worth paying, so I am not interrupted by loud adds. That can be kind of embarassing at a stop light."

I believe the difference is that Pandora has humans do the categorizing rather than a computer. If you are serious about music --- it is the center of my life --- you must get Pandora AND sign up for the paid Pandora One subscription.

"16909","Pandora","All about those ads, (about those ads) no music","Livi","July 22, 2017",1,"So when I downloaded this app, I found that it's conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone.  I didn't mind the idea of watching ads, because it's a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow.  But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for.  But that's not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad.  I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you're given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well.  Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you're not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like ""rewind""; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a "" like/dislike"" on the track.  I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, didn't take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I didn't want to be hearing.

Which they said they had before. They still probably don't. Thwy let you skip 5 songs and say sorry we know you're sucker and paid for this but we aren't lerting you hear just what you want. Here are a few songs that are free that suck listen to them. Oh you made a Dave Matthews band station? Sorry you'll hear 3 then have to change it hahahahahhahaha."

There are a few more commercials than before, but not that many and far less than local radio, and you can pay to have none at all.  You can get a great varity by entering you favorite artist, then choose some preset stations and choose shuffle all stations.  And the best thing is my car stereo has bluetooth and I listen to pandora with my phone and it plays through the stereo, I've had very few lost connections with 3G and rarely have songs cut off like others have said, but it does happen on occasion.  I also play it on my home computer.  Its free and I love it."

If you want to hear all of your radio selections all you have to do is push the shuffle button and you can hear all the songs you want. Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can't pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and author(s)put you can't pick the song. Pandora doesn't have station either, which I'm thankful for."

Streaming quality is pretty good.FYI - The pop-up Advertisements are there (Apart from regular Ads between songs randomly) as this is the 'free' version of the App and it bothers me at times as I cannot Skip tracks when Ads are present but I can live with that for now knowing that it is a free Application.I also like that you can let Pandora stream music in the background while I do other things on Kindle Fire.

My only problem with it is that it picks songs for you based on the station you create on it. You can't actually pick the song itself, so there are some songs you don't like on it. Pandora learns what you like and don't like by you giving the song a thumbs up or down. Overall, it's a great app. I would have given it 5 stars if you could pick the song!"

Name an artist and voila, you have a ""station "" that will deliver tunes by that artist and similar artist. One caveat, if you listen a lot (and I do) you will soon recognize the limit to the tunes by your rave artist that will repeat. Usually these will be the songs you would expect on a ""greatest hits "" album and often that is exactly where they come from.But hey, if you get bored with the repeats,  quickly create a new station.This app can't.

With regards to my Kindle Fire HDX, I would say that performance and functionality have gotten a whole lot better. That said, my taste in music services has changed. I would recommend instead, either Songza or Spotify. Still, Pandora is a pretty solid offering and the app is several times better than it used to be.***Old Review 2012***This app used to be a good one on the Kindle. Now it plays two songs and just stops. Completely Useless. It's part of the reason why I don't subscribe to avoid having ads. Based on other reviews, they don't seem in a hurry to fix this, so why bother upgrading? Bad Business.Update (Same day): So after posting this review, I removed the app from my Kindle Fire and then re-downloaded it from the App Store. Now it appears to be working as it used too. So I've changed the rating to reflect this.Another Update (Same day): So it appears to play the songs without any problem, but when an ad pops up, the app just stops and you have to quit and relaunch to get it going again. So even a reinstall won't fix this. I'll reiterate as mentioned before, Bad Business!"

Even stations I've created that I thought would be just to try out, have become some of my faves!The brief commercial breaks aren't a problem at all.If you are on the fence like I was at first, give it a try, I believe you will get addicted like I have."

I less frequently listen to my recorded music now.  The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service.  Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker.  Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time."
"17062","Pandora","Personal heart-warming radio station","Annette J. Teixeira","April 25, 2014",5,"Pandora is fabulous for anyone who loves music. The novel idea is that we control every piece we hear.  By choosing the artist, or title of the piece we enjoy, (or group of artists) - we are then gifted with our choices and also other pieces in the same genre.  Additionally we can choose to shuffle through our entire list or stay with one choice, whatever our  mood. I would encourage everyone to experience this for themselves.  Best of all it's free."

As for the songs, I'm a fan of Industrial music and it seems as tho Pandora only plays songs by 6 or 7 different bands.  I KNOW there are more Industrial bands out there!  It serves it's purpose, it keeps my niece dancing on bad days, but the amount of ads is getting insane.  It isn't driving me to upgrade, it's driving me to find another service."

If you give the thumbs up for songs, they tend to play them and others like it more often.  The commercials are fine and not very long so they aren't really a problem.  I like that you can also purchase a song that is on as well right from the app. Would definitely recommend it."

You can create your own stations on any music you like and publish them for the community. What I really like is you get a bio about the artists you choose to hear.

The one thing it needs is more ways to sort stations like by genre or have a favorites bar, or playlists. that is what would make it even better then now.

I understand I'm using the free version of Pandora but there should be a way to disable those types of ads while still being able to listen to my favorite songs that have slight profanity in them. other than that, good app."

Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I'd get a message telling me they're experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there's a ""quit"" option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the ""quit"" option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!"

"17184","Pandora","MOSTLY ANNOYING","J. STEVENSON","April 28, 2017",3,"I don't care for Pandora for this reason;  You create a station with an artist.  I thought I would only be listening to that particular artist.Unfortunately, Pandora takes it upon themselves to add other artists that they consider to be of the same genre.  I am passionate about my music and I resent having a computer tell me what to listen to.  For instance, I may want to listen to Bob Dylan only, there are a few Dylan songs and then suddenly I'm listening to Bruce Springsteen.  Can't stand that.  I would like to pick my own music which is why I stick with ITunes."

I do not sign out to end the music, only ""Quit"" because it's very difficult to sign in.

THERE'S AN ANSWER, CHEAPOS. Pay a piddling amount for a year of commercial-free Pandora and help the company stay afloat. You'll also get a great-quality stream. The only reason that Slacker may hags fewer ads is that (a)  they can't find the advertisers and (b) they haven't burned through their capital yet. Meanwhile, NOBODY beats Pandora's Music Genome algorhythm at sussing out new music you'll love. They're easily best in breed. FIVE STARS. Try it and if you love it but hate the ads, pay the piper.

Pandora actually muted itself while the trailer was playing and picked back up right when the trailer was over.  I didn't have to do anything!  What a smart and convenient app!"

I wasn't sure if I had had a separate pass word for Pandora.  Was it my password for Amazon? This was confusing so they did not load it onto my kindle however they seem to think it is on. I am not sure how to go about getting it now. I do like Pandora on my Ipod"
"17226","Pandora","Wonderful!","Turtle","October 13, 2012",5,"I always have and always will love the services Pandora provides. I get to listen to newer songs by the artists I adore and never have to pay a penny for it(unless I cannot live without the song in question)! And the way Pandora is set up for my Kindle Fire HD is far superior to the application on my iTouch. This version hardly ever freezes and does not deliver choppy music. I think there are far less bugs in this version. So, in short, great product that I use daily."

And I don't get these reviews saying that commercials interrupt the songs, cuz they don't. You'll get like one commercial every 3 or 4 songs with little pop up ads. while listening. And since my kindle's on lock most of the time when I'm listening, or since I'm doing other things like playing games or on the web, it doesn't matter cuz I cant see the ads. I like this app a whole lot, and ill probably be a loyal fan for years."

The music choices usually (but not always) stay true to the type of music played by the original artist you've chosen.  Surprised, though, that there is no choice for Beethoven or some of the other Classical greats, but it may be that my search capabilities aren't that great when searching for artists and music.  Even so, it's a great way to add the kind of music you like."
"17262","Pandora","Great app","suzy kiker","April 22, 2015",4,"I love this app, I love that you can change channels and search for channels that is great because you can listen to different artists and music.

I don't like that in the beginning while you are ""teaching"" it what you like, you can only fast forward so many times.  And even though you can't go back and listen to a specific artist/album like in Spotify, it's suggestions are still much, much better.  So if I want something possible new mixed in with what I like I use Pandora."
"17268","Pandora","Love Pandora!","Kindle Customer","December 15, 2013",5,"I listened for hours several days this week to the Christmas station, hearing wonderful songs, with some suggestions from me, while wrapping gifts and sitting by the fire. I love Pandora's varied choices for me. I am never bored, I often sing along, and if one they choose is not right for my mood at the moment, I can delete it and get another one immediately. The ads are few. And finally, its free!  What's not to like?"
"17269","Pandora","awesome just pure awesome","epic gamer 1418","February 2, 2014",5,"I love this app! After you've made a couple stations and have thumb-upped or thumb-downed a bunch of songs, you can just put it on shuffle (which I love) and just relax and listen to music. What I also love about this app is that you can go to your home screen and play games and still listen to music! Which is why it has a 5 star rating from me. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes music!"

Very easy to add stations and all the things you can do with iton the PC. But on the kindle, I need to go to the settings and log off before I shutdown, otherwisewhen it starts back up, it freezes on the opening blue screen and I need to remove it from the deviceand re-download from the cloud to get it to work again - after reinstalling you get the login screenlike you would if you had logged off.So, its ok, its just that you can't remain logged in, and that's a bit inconvenient."

Well one day, I got a message saying that I had exceeded my limit of 40 hours that month. It said if I would just pay $.99 I could listen for the rest of the month for free. Since I loved it so much I took the offer. I then proceeded to leave the app after it said I had successfully purchased my rest of the month. When I came back later that day, it gave me the same message. I figure it just didn't register the first time so I went and checked my acount. When I looked Pandora did take the $.99 from me but didn't register it. Being annoyed I just paid again. Then I was listening to my music and it kept skipping songs. My mother told me to uninstall it and then reinstall it. So I uninstalled it. When I went to reinstall, it kept failing. So that means I lost $2 to Pandora. I know it's not much, but when I only get a gift card of $25 for my kindle on gift giving holidays, it makes me a bit frustrated. I want my money back! How do I ask for it back?"

One feature I really like is the ability to link to Amazon's mp3 store for an item corresponding to what you're listening to (if you like what you're hearing and want to buy it).

And then my Pandora started acting up, at first not very often it would just sit there after a song was done playing and it would just load, I would just go out of it and come back and it was fine, then that started becoming more frequent, and just now, I tried to go onto Pandora and every station I tried, Pandora just kept skipping all the songs, none of them would play they just kept coming on and then just skipped it, even the ads would be skipped. I tried deleting the app and put it back on, it would do the same thing. I deleted it and reinstalled it again 3 times, I tried everything, nothing would make it stop it just kept skipping all the songs. I am done with it, this is ridiculous, if it isn't fixed ASAP I'm just done with Pandora and I'm finding a new radio app."

"17425","Pandora","Great for the car","Deliuta","December 5, 2011",5,"I downloaded this app 6 months ago on my Droid X and recently on my Droid X 2. Both times, I've enjoyed plugging in my phone with an audio jack into my car and surfing my stations. It sucks up battery pretty fast, so I also charge my phone in the car while listening to Pandora. And it only works if you have wifi or 3G available which isn't an issue unless you're driving far out in the countryside.I recommend this app and want to mention that I haven't had songs skip or not fully play.If I will, I'll update this review."
"17426","Pandora","great music but has flaws","Kindle Customer","January 2, 2014",4,"Pandora has great quality, but when you make a station it will play a lot of different artists. Not even 50 percent of the music is the artist the station is supposed to play. You can skip songs, but you only get a certain number of skips. It also has adds. You have to pay $4.00 monthly to get no adds and other things that may annoy you. Overall it's a very nice app."

Having some control over what music you want to hear just sounded too good to be true.  It really is as simple as that.  Well, Pandora, I think I love you.I use this app on my Kindle Fire.  I love just about everything.  One thing I wish that app could do is show the list of the songs I have 'thumbs upped'.  As far as I know, this app cannot do that.

Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire.  I love it.  I think it is so neat how you make a album, type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song, then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist.  And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again.  It remembers.  The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder.  The way it is not you get to hear those you love, but others too and might not like everything playing.  Sometimes I don't want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country, rap, techno etc.  I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things."

You get some type of advert almost any time you perform an action. For example, you click to view an artists details, you go back to the song, there is an ad. The ad sizes vary in size and the 'x' to close them out is very tiny so what happens is you go to close an ad, for the fifth time in one track, and you end up launching the browser and getting hit with the ad.

"17462","Pandora","Ok...","saigahunter","February 9, 2015",3,"It is a good app, for the most part, but it has some problems. For starters, the ads. A few times, it played an ad in the middle of a song! Also, it is possible to taylor the station to play what you want, but once you do, it is stuck that way! Even if you delete the thumbs up and down, the radio is still not very diverse. Also, it doesn't have that much music, and it gets albums on very slowly.All in all, three stars, for problems."

Its really great that you do t have to go and buy your music for $ 1.00 but I think that they should update it because it plays songs twice after hitting the thumbs down button but at the same time I like to make sure that I don't want to hear that song. I also do t like that you have minnimum of 6 skips and that the commercials are pointless and stupid, I give it 2 thumbs up!:)"

My only complaint about Pandora is that you can't pick specific song's or artists that you want to hear, they just match you up to song's similar to the song and artist of your choosing, which can be frustrating but it's better than the radio for background music and I knew what I was getting so I still gave a 5 star rating."

Recently got a Kindle Fire and, again, it's great.Unfortunately, recently it has had the tendency to occasionally start a song and freeze and skip after about 20 seconds. Also, I understand the need for ads, but recently they've gotten a bit overnumerous and repetitive.But I love Pandora; it introduces you to new music, lets you customize your station based on the type of music you like, and the fact that you can now listen to Pandora without the 40-hour limit per month makes it only better.I only wish the ads were a little shorter, more varied, and maybe a little less often. Also, the slight buginess needs to be addressed. But still, a solid app, especially for fans of Pandora online just getting smartphones or tablets. Four stars, easily."

"17524","Pandora","Efficient control over what you listen to","Elmer W Martin","July 13, 2013",5,"What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel.  You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy.  Lots of programs can play one group over and over.  Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."

In the case of Pandora's app the price is getting an annoying pop-up ad box in the center of the display virtually every 2 seconds. The curse, if you don't upgrade you will be haunted by never ending ads until time immemorial. Given that ad curse, you might think that they'd only deliver the Blues. But, to be fair, there are considerably more music genres to choose from. Hence the 2nd star. We each have different patience levels.

Then songs will play and if you like them you push the thumbs up and if you don't push the thumbs down. This app is the best! You won't regret it at all."

I have always loved music, and the only way I knew to play it was by putting on a record, or as time went by, a compact disc. Pandora, when I finally discovered it, was a revelation. I could create my own stations...and suddenly my home was filled with Bach, Thomas Newman, Argo Part or when we had guests, an easy listening station. But slowly the app died. It would play one song and refuse to play another. This happened more and more frequently and I finally gave up and downloaded Songa. It works fine. Goodbye Pandora.***5/23/13***I have returned to Pandora! They repaired the app. Sure, there are more commercials but that's ok. Try it, you can't beat the price.

"17846","Pandora","Good music.","James K. Carnine","December 22, 2012",4,"Nice job of permitting selection/rejection of desired music. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. There!"
"17847","Pandora","Good music--the way I like it","Anita L. Moss","May 25, 2014",4,"I like Pandora because you can choose the songs, artists, genre, etc. that you most enjoy. You even have the choice of liking or not a particular arrangement of a favorite song. Very helpful in providing background music while working."
"17848","Pandora","Great Selection","Amazon Customer","August 28, 2016",5,"Great selection of a variety of types and styles of music."

"17850","Pandora","But not nearly as good as","Amazon Customer","March 6, 2016",3,"Can't pick specific songs ...  Volume is inconsistent... OK ... But not nearly as good as Spotify"
"17851","Pandora","It's Alright","Wendy Trevino","December 30, 2016",4,"The app itself has a great layout and it functions fine most of the time. The only real issue I see is that the app continues to crash at random points while I'm listening to my music. While this is an issue I hope gets fixed quickly, I don't think you shouldn't get it just for that reason. The music plays fine and it goes on for a good hour or so before shutting off. I rate this 4/5 only because of that one problem."
"17852","Pandora","Love Pandora!","Donald Greenberg","August 17, 2013",5,"I love music and Pandora makes it really easy to listen to the music I love.  Where else can I get my BB King fix while I exercise at the gym?  Okay, so every once in a while I have to listen to a commercial, so what?  On typical broadcast radio there are many, many more commercials and the music generally is....(can I say this?) crap!Another great feature is that I can listen to Pandora at home on my Roku."
"17853","Pandora","Definitely improved!","realmary","September 12, 2014",5,"Originally, when I reviewed Pandora I gave it one star due to too many commercials. Since I've gotten my Echo I noticed that problem has greatly improved! Pandora listened and now the commercials are manageable."
"17854","Pandora","Love it","Tessa","January 7, 2014",5,"I love the fact that you dictate what kind of music you want.  I listen to everything so I can have separate stations made up with whatever mood I'm in for the day.  I have my workout music on one station and I don't have to worry about skipping thru the songs."
"17855","Pandora","Gr8 App!","J. D&iacute;az","August 25, 2012",5,"Pandora is such a great app on KF, been using it for awhile now it is really outstanding how selective playlists can be organized for your pleasure. Only complaint is when are you pushing their latest update on Amazon app store, it is available now on Google play don't know why Amazon takes ages for updates on Android apps which are already out."
"17856","Pandora","Review","Ken B.Avraham","July 15, 2016",4,"The only flaw is the loading and amount of skips on certain song's."
"17857","Pandora","its bad","Dawn Lombardi","June 24, 2013",2,"its ok but if u type in the song you want to hear you wont even get to hear it. plus if you type in the artist you willnget other artists not even in the same genre. I reccomend the app tune In although you cant listen to the song you want you can listen to radio stations worldwide plus its free"
"17858","Pandora","stop with the ads","J. Haynes","August 7, 2013",3,"Pandora free is good until the commercials get in there. I just had, literally not joking, a Dyson commercial pop up every time I skipped a song. I skipped six songs in a row and what do you know a 30 second Dyson commercial every time I skipped. I saw that commercial at least six times."
"17859","Pandora","Can't understand.","James","January 12, 2012",5,"I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure. This is a great app I have it on four different devices. Never had anything but stellar service on 3g 4g or wi-fi. My wife and kids love this app as well. I would give ten stars if I could."
"17860","Pandora","pandora is always good","Pen Name","July 18, 2015",5,"I been using the app for 5 yrs now and still running strong. After using it for time I I'll buy the full version with out commercial it's a good app"

"17862","Pandora","Now better than I Heart Radio","Jeccaamato","September 7, 2012",5,"Pandora was a pain, so was using I Heart. Since the update, so much better. Easier to navigate, lists the lyrics, love the selection of stations and music. Created a station I love. But if you are looking for more eclectic artists and to discover new tunes, stick with I Heart. Also love if there's a song I hate,I never have to hear it again."
"17863","Pandora","Excellence in Every Way!","Angela","October 8, 2012",5,"The absolutely best music service available.  I am introduced to new music based on my preferences and also hear my favorites from a variety of genres.  Very little repetition through the week and somehow the algorithm they use manages to intuit what type of music I might like at night or on a weekend vs. mid-week.  I just love Pandora!"
"17864","Pandora","GREAT  APP","J. Johnson-Price","December 8, 2014",4,"Pandora. is a really good app but the one thing I do not like is the stations for.example I create a beyonce station and it plays a bunch of others artists songs but other than that its great"
"17865","Pandora","A really nice app.:","Amazon Customer","July 26, 2012",5,"I like it even though there are some repetitive ads. (whats up with that kroger one?) And that sometimes songs I dont like come on but I am a big fan of the thumbs up and down thing. That is very helpful. Overall I like this app although I am still pondering over the fact that I type in the fray and get a country song. But I still love this app.."
"17866","Pandora","Works most times","zimmy","March 31, 2013",3,"I don't use these type of apps often because I have over 50000 songs in my cloud, but when I do use Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD, it works most times. Seems to stop playing after a few hours though and has commercials. When I use on my LG home theater (built into that) it never plays commercials and never quits until I turn it off. Not bad though for a free music radio. I tend to use Songza more often on the Fire HD then this one though."
"17867","Pandora","Love it :)","MSandy02","March 30, 2012",4,"I like Pandora a lot because I love listening to music and whenever I gotta work or do stuff, I just listen to it. I can make new stations and if I don't like a song, just put thumbs down. But it's kinda annoying how they have the same old commercials over and over again. They should try to put other commercials as well, or not at all. I prefer no commercials :)"
"17868","Pandora","Lexi(:","A. Norton","June 10, 2013",5,"Being one that is very picky when it comes to music providers, I surprisingly loved Pandora. They have every variety of music genres. The only thing I do not like is your limited on songs you can skip and you have to pay in order to not have advertisements. But they have to make money some way."

"17872","Pandora","Good","I am awesome","March 17, 2014",4,"I love the way you can make your own personal stations but I don't like how you have to create an account and you have to have wifi to play music. but if you have wick and don't mind creating a free account then get this app it is satisfying."
"17873","Pandora","MUSIC!","Kristen Smith","April 4, 2013",5,"I love having music and a variety of it. I don't buy cds or anything anymore and the regular radio plays too much of the same things or have too many commercials/talk shows. I may have the free version but the commercials really are not intrusive and I can easily look over it. I like to be surprised with songs that I love but may not have heard in awhile or didn't know who did them."

I don't see why people are complaining, everything it plays is based off the information you give the program.

"18180","Pandora","permissions","rrunswickjr","December 5, 2011",3,"Why does this application need access to permissions such as my contact list in order to play music?It is a known issue on the iOS version of the application- tracking personally identifiable information such as GPS coordinates.  I find it astonishing that the company has made no comment to the tech news press about why they need such information, or why it has to be pinged so frequently.  I understand that they need general location data for advertisements, but ""up to the minute"" is completely unnecessary.  What is this company up to?"

There's a known bug that forces you to unplug your television in order to exit the App.  You should also know ahead of time that there's no telephone for Customer Service and that Customer Service available by E-Mail is neither expedient nor helpful.There are better music subscription choices."

The yearly license is worth the small investment. XM radio and Sirius cannot compete with this. The only drawback if there is one is that they have a time limit where if you don't rate/skip a track or whatever it will go into a play pause mode until you tell them you are still listening.

"18408","Pandora","It's not as customizable as one might think...","Pamela T.","November 17, 2011",1,"For something that touts itself as internet radio, it's customization options are ridiculously limited. One might assume that, since it asks you to enter an artist's name to create your own personalized radio station, that you will be listening to that artist on said station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you've likely never heard of and that have nothing to do with the artist you entered. If it allowed you to enter artists you want to hear songs by and then actually played songs by those artists, and *only* those artists, I would no doubt give it a higher rank. The commercals and skip limits just make it all the worse. In short, if you are picky about your music, look elsewhere. This isn't going to give you many real options for customizing your personal ""station"".Signed, Pamela T."
